I’m deliberately left out of the team meetings for a reason.”
“Oh, I think you might be surprised at how much info you actually hold in that pretty little head of yours,” he argued. “In fact, I’m willing to bet it’s

only going to cost your bodyguards all of their fingers to find out.” I chuckled when I saw Clive and Owen both roll their eyes.
“Well, that is one of their job duties, so by all means, waste your time long enough for Darren to return.”
He tsk’d, shaking his head. “You would have me torture and kill them just to protect your murderer of a husband?” he accused, pointing at Clive and Owen.
I leveled him with a glare. “Dying for me is literally their fucking job. What, you think Darren would spare them if I got killed on their watch?” I laughed and shook my head. “He’d make their death twenty times worse than anything you could possibly do to them. So you’d actually be doing them a favor.”
Now, he looked frustrated.
“So like I said before, I don’t know shit about shit.”
Smith took a few steps toward me. “Alright then, let’s test your theory.” He marched over to me, raising the blade over his head.
I braced for the impact, but instead of pain, I heard two muffled gunshots echo from a silencer behind me, piercing into Smith’s gut and chest.
“What the fuck?” he grumbled, the look of shock and confusion painting his face before he fell to the floor with a loud thump. None of the remaining men in the room even flinched at the shooting, no one moving to help him or return fire.
What the hell was going on?
“Sorry about that little display. My phone call took longer than I expected,” said a familiar voice from behind me.
I knew that fucking voice.
The last person I expected to see walked from around my chair and leaned over me, a smug smile across his face. He gave me a little finger wave with his black leather gloved hand.

“Matt?”
His grin widened as he tucked his gun back into his holster. “Hello, Jaden,” he taunted. “Comfortable?”
“What the fuck is this? Why did you just kill him?”
He stepped away from the chair, placing his hands in his pockets, and turned to snicker at me.
“Like he said, he was just the hired hand.”
I scowled at him. “Where’s Darren? How did you even get in here?”
Matt sighed like he was annoyed, the shadows of the room hiding his eyes as he leaned against one of the broken couches.
“He’s about to be busy for the next hour or two. So we have plenty of time to chat.”
I furrowed my brows, my muscles tensing from his words. “Why? Just so you can send Darren a stupid message?”
He scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Actually, I’m here to forward you a message.”
My brows furrowed deeper.
“You see, I was recently visited by a ghost,” he added. “A very young, pretty, blonde ghost.”
My stomach instantly dropped, my eyes widening with shock.
Oh no. He found her first. Fuck!
“What the fuck did you do?” I snarled.
Matt marched toward me in three steps and backhanded me across the face.
“What did I do?! Do you have any idea what you’ve done?!” he roared down at me.
I spit out the blood that burst into my mouth. “You mean saved her from a life of sexual servitude? Yeah, shame on me.”
He scoffed dramatically. “Oh please, spare me your hero complex. I don’t have time for that shit.”

“What have you done with her? Where is she?”
Matt scoffed. “I haven’t done anything with her because I don’t have
her,” he snarled. “Yet.”
I glared at him, my wrists straining in my binds, but I took solace in the relief I felt knowing Kayla was still free of him. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
Matt placed his hands over his hips, sucking in a breath like he was having a hard time finding the words.
“Kayla has apparently teamed up with your old boyfriend to take Darren and his organization down.”
My brain froze, and my heart stopped. No way I just heard that. “What did you just say?”
He dipped his chin, his gaze all business. “You heard me loud and fucking clear.”
I blinked, looking away to stare off into space as my reality shifted on its axis.
Was this real? Had this really happened? No, it could be a trick. Don’t fall for it. “Prove it,” I demanded.
Matt folded his arms across his chest, exhaling heavily. “Jason said you would know what Wily Wilder meant. Something about stealing a class pet from school or something?”
My breath caught in my chest, neurons firing in my brain like a pinball machine, bouncing against the walls, struggling to make a connection. Wily Wilder was a nickname I’d gotten in the second grade when my teacher caught me trying to sneak the class pet out of the classroom by hiding it in my backpack. But the little danger noodle slithered through a hole in the fabric and plopped out right onto my teacher’s desk as I headed for the door. The nickname stuck when I got caught for the third and final time.

“He also said that walking away from you in that bathroom in Rome was the hardest thing he’s ever had to do.”
My stomach dropped, the memory causing my eyes to water from an emotion I couldn’t afford to lose myself in right now. But I just couldn’t help it—hope and relief fluttering in my heart like a storm of freed butterflies.
She did it. Kayla found Jason. She actually made it out! She was safe! “Holy shit,” I whispered to myself, my heart rate jumping through the
roof. And then I grinned up at Matt like a goddamn fool. “That’s fucking awesome!”
My hype was only slightly compromised when Matt’s fist connected with my other cheek, the blow rocking my chair.
“Silence!” he bellowed. But even as the fierce pain radiated throughout my skull, I couldn’t stop the joyous laughter rolling up my throat.
“Did you just say silence? What are you, a Disney villain?” I chuckled through the sting.
“You took away the one thing that I actually gave a shit about in this world, so it probably wouldn’t be wise to celebrate in front of me, especially since those two are the only reasons you’re currently still breathing,” Matt warned, his voice rough like gravel.
And still, as my cheek began to swell, I laughed. “Yeah, forcing Kayla to sit on the floor and eat from your hand like a fucking animal just screams tender, loving care. Eat a dick, Matt. You never cared about her,” I retorted, unfazed. “You just wanted to own her.”
He looked at me like he wanted nothing more than to slaughter me, but I couldn’t stop smiling, practically dancing in my chair over the fact that Kayla had done it. Something we had planned had actually succeeded for once, and it made everything that Darren had done to me over it worth every torturous second.

Though, despite my hopes, Jason and Kayla teaming up with Matt was not something I had on my Operation Take Down bingo card. His involvement in all of this would surely make everything much more complicated. Could this asshole even be trusted? Was Kayla even safe with him around?
Matt shook his head as he watched the imaginary wheels in my head turn in every direction, a scowl curling in the corner of his mouth. “You know, I almost felt sorry when you got shot during your training exercise, but now I can see you very much deserved it,” he snipped, tightening his arms across his chest.
My humor and excitement screeched to a halt at the mention of my gunshot wound. “What.”
“At first, it was nothing personal, but that was before I found out you had an actual hand in Kayla’s escape and lied about it. You’re lucky Jason contacted me when he did. Otherwise, you might have already been dead by now, and he would be useless to me.”
My scowl morphed into something more sinister as I tilted my head at him. “Are you trying to tell me that “accidental” bullet I took was actually an assassination attempt orchestrated by you?”
Matt rolled his eyes. “Don’t be so dramatic, Jaden. The only thing I attempted to do was buy some moles and cause a little chaos, which I clearly did. But if that chaos ultimately led to your death, well, then that’s just the way the dice rolls.”
I felt my jaw crushing my teeth into dust from how hard I was clenching it. He was just so nonchalant about almost getting me killed. I hope Jason kicked the shit out of him for it, if he even knew.
“Does Darren know this?” I asked. He had never once mentioned any motive behind the shooting, let alone Matt’s involvement, and his temper was not worth the investigation.

Matt shrugged, a smug smile tugging on his lips. “Manipulating Darren’s newbies into thinking something was their idea was easier than I thought, so I have no idea what conclusions he came to. It’s just too bad those idiots lacked the brain cells to actually conceal their tracks. They could have really come in handy a few months ago.”
I felt my brows knitting together as I narrowed my gaze at him. Deep down, I knew getting shot couldn’t have been a freak accident, and it appeared that I was right. In the end, Matt didn’t realize the favor he had actually done me. What a twisted touch of fate.
“Well, Matt, if that’s the case, then I suppose in a weird way, I should be thanking you. That bullet took out one of my ovaries,” I informed him. “Which bought me some extra time in avoiding the prospect of motherhood. So…thanks for that.”
Matt cocked a brow as he stared back at me. “I imagine then, given the multiple months you’ve had to heal, your extra time is almost up.”
I nodded gravely at his clear understanding of my own fragile timetable. Matt’s eyes glimmered with dark amusement as he dropped his chin. “It would appear then that the stakes in time have just been raised,” he sneered as he took a step closer. “So if you want my fucking help then I suggest you
watch your smart-ass mouth and listen before I change my mind.”
I glowered at him. “You know he’s looking for her, right? He knows she’s alive.”
If Matt was so keen on protecting Kayla, then he needed to know to ensure she didn’t end up in Darren’s clutches too. I did not want him finding her.
He glared at me, hatred brimming in his eyes. “Of course I’m aware, that’s old news. But I am however curious if he ever discovered the part you played in it?”
I hesitated for a moment, wondering how much I should divulge, if it really even mattered at this point. Matt slowly tilted his chin up as he stared

down at me, cruelty curling in the corners of his lips.
“Judging by your silence and those pretty fading bruises around your throat, I’m going to say that’s a yes.” He chuckled, crossing his arms in front of his chest as he meandered through the room. “I can only imagine how he must have rectified that. But considering his methods, I hope he was exceptionally brutal.”
I snickered, tilting my head in a taunting manner. “He almost killed me.”
“Yet here you stand. Or sit, rather.” He actually sounded disappointed.
I shrugged, stretching the strain in my neck. “What doesn’t kill you and all that bullshit, right?” I mused. “So, what, you’re working with Jason and Kayla now? How the hell did that happen?”
Matt sneered as he turned toward me. “Believe it or not, Kayla actually came to me, seeking my help.”
My brows furrowed, unsure of how much I could genuinely trust his words.
“Is that so?”
“Yeah, it’s so,” he growled. “As it turns out, the enemy of their enemy is their friend.”
I snorted. “Oh, so you’re their friend now, is that it? Someone they can trust?”
Matt’s eyes hardened. “Trust doesn’t exist in our world. The only thing you can rely on is what’s in everyone’s best interest. And right now, working with them just so happens to be in my best interest.”
“How’d you figure that? What’s in it for you?”
“Never mind what’s in it for me. What matters is whether you’re going to join the cause. Or do you prefer to just sit on your ass and wait to be rescued?”
I scowled at the insult. I was the whole fucking reason a “rescue” operation even existed.

“Or,” he continued, a sly smile curling his lips, “have you finally grown to enjoy your pampered captivity? Those bruises might suggest otherwise, though. Or maybe you like wearing them?”
Pampered. Cute word for literal abuse.
My eyes slid over to Clive and Owen, their eyes flashing with warning and concern. Dread penetrated my gut like a spear when I realized what they were currently witnessing, but it pierced even deeper when I suddenly understood why it didn’t matter. And they already knew it. Even if it didn’t come from Matt, it would certainly come from Darren.
Ah, shit.
“Don’t look at me like that,” I told them. “You know damn well Darren will execute you both for whatever happens tonight, so there’s no sense in maintaining any loyalty now.”
Matt snapped his fingers in my face. “Focus, Jaden. We don’t have all damn night.”
I nearly growled at him. “How about you let me out of this chair first, and then we can really talk,” I argued, pulling against my binds in irritation.
Matt shook his head. “You’re exactly where you need to be.” I scowled at him. “How the fu—”
“Shut up and pay attention. You need to convince Darren to take you to the country estate where you were married,” he interrupted abruptly. “And you need to do this within the next two days, because on that third day, we’re going to attack the country estate. So you need to make sure Darren is actually there for it to happen as planned.”
All I could do was blink. Had I seriously heard him correctly? They were going to attack the country estate?
“Around noon, you’ll want to find a way to put as much distance between you and that house as you can. Unless you want to be in the middle of one hell of a fire fight.”

I shook my head to regain my stunned composure. “Wait. What? Why there? You know where he lives. Why not just attack his main home?”
“Because it’s a fucking fortress we don’t yet have the resources for. His country estate will be easier to attack.”
I furrowed my brow. “Then why didn’t you just attack him here? You’ve made it this far. Why not just finish the job?”
Matt rolled his eyes. “Because this is a fucking hotel and not exactly the best place for a battleground, Jaden. Not to mention, it’s also Chicago. You can’t just walk into someone else’s backyard and start pissing everywhere. We still live by a few codes, you know, and they help keep the chaos at bay.”
I cocked a brow, his excuse far too humorous to ignore. “Politics?
Seriously? That’s your excuse?”
Matt groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose. “For fuck’s sake, Jaden, I don’t have time to teach you Underground Crime 101.” Maybe he didn’t, but I wasn’t going to lose out on the opportunity to frustrate the shit out of him while I still could.
“Okay, fine, and then what? What happens after I get him to the estate?” “And then you can fuck off with your new life,” he answered, annoyed. “So long as you complete your part in this, you could finally be a free little
bird in just a few days.”
A moment of silence allowed for a new understanding to attach—I could be free. In just a few days, I could be back with my family, back with Jason—a free woman. All I had to do was convince Darren to get me there.
“Wait, will Jason be in that fight?” I asked, my chest suddenly feeling tight. “What exactly did you discuss?”
Matt looked at me with strained irritation. “Jesus Christ, Jaden, what part of I don’t have time for all the goddamn details are you not getting? I can’t guarantee he’ll be there, I can’t even guarantee this operation will even launch,” he pressed. “Now, can you convince Darren or not?”

My eyes shot to his with an affirmative nod. I had to. There was absolutely no other choice. “Yes.”
Matt released a small sigh of relief. He had more faith in me than I did, but I would find a way to convince Darren. Whatever it took.
“Good,” he said with a nod, placing his hands in his pockets. “I didn’t set this whole thing up just for you to bitch out when it actually counts.”
I scoffed. “I think you could have found a much easier way to communicate with me. Jason was able to figure it out once, and he has even less resources than you do.”
Matt returned my chide with a wide sneer. “Yes well, a good cover story was needed for this situation. Plus, I just love fucking up Darren’s shit every now and then when the opportunity arises. I like reminding him that he’s not as invincible as he thinks he is.”
“I think you’ve succeeded,” I said carefully.
“Not quite,” he stated then waved his hand at the other guards. “There’s still one more matter to rectify.” Two of the men came forward with baseball bats dragging behind them, stopping just behind Clive and Owen.
“What are you doing?” I asked, panic spiking.
“I was hoping your dog would be here tonight, but my men can’t seem to find her. I thought her loss would have been sufficient payback, but since she’s not here…I had to improvise.”
My heart dropped into my stomach. “What?”
“You cost me my greatest treasure,” Matt growled, pure malice on his tongue, hate in his eyes, and pointed at my bodyguards. “And now they’re going to pay for it.”
My heart dropped as Clive and Owen looked back at me with nothing but solidarity and obvious understanding. They knew they were dead the second Matt walked into the room. He couldn’t let them live with everything they just heard, even if it was deliberate. And Darren wouldn’t have let them live simply for tonight’s failure to protect me from harm.

“I thought that bullet I took was payback.” “Hardly,” Matt answered bitterly.
My mouth went dry. While Clive and Owen weren’t exactly my favorite people in the world, I had become fond of our banter and the routine we’d created over the years. And now all of that was about to come to a very violent end.
Both of them gave me a slight nod, implying their acceptance. They knew the risks of assuming the roles as my protectors, and they accepted anyway. I figured they would bite the dust on duty at some point. I just didn’t think I’d have to witness it like this. Nodding back, I signaled my silent goodbye to them, finding it to be harder than I wanted to admit.
With the snap of Matt’s fingers, the two guards lifted their bats and swung. I sat like a statue, bound to my chair, and watched as Matt’s goons beat my bodyguards to death with their baseball bats. For once, I had never been more grateful for the darkness.
The sound of wood beating against muscle and bone was far too distinct for my liking, my stomach souring with each swing. After all the training I’d endured, I could hide it well enough on the outside, but the inside never settled when I witnessed torture.
It took about two minutes before their bodies finally went limp, blood coating both of them, the bats, and the guards. When they were finished, they stepped away from what was left of my barely recognizable bodyguards and dropped one of the bloody bats near Smith’s body.
“Satisfied?” I muttered to Matt, not taking my eyes off my dead guards. I wanted to savor this rage for later—when I eventually killed this motherfucker.
Matt moved in front of me, glaring down with a raging fire in his eyes. “Not until I get Kayla back. And believe me when I say I will.”
I met his gaze head-on. “Is that what you think is going to happen? That you’re going to win Kayla back after what you’ve done to her?”

“It’s cute you think I give a shit about what Kayla wants,” Matt answered as he walked to the side of my chair.
“I’ll make sure she fucking knows that,” I growled up at him.
Matt chuckled as he gripped the arms of my chair. “Believe me, Jaden, she already does.” And then he yanked the chair up and shoved me over until I crashed sideways into the carpet, the impact making my damn bones rattle and my pelvis throb.
“What the hell!”
Matt then took the gun with the silencer and placed it on the floor near my hand, just barely within reach.
“Smith is your cover story,” he said pointedly, leaning over me. “I don’t care what you tell Darren. He has plenty of enemies, pick one. But remember what I told you. Third day at noon. Don’t fuck it up.”
I damn near hissed at him. “I’ll see you there, asshole.”
A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips as he stood. “For your sake, I hope not.”
And with that, he and his men walked out of my sight, leaving me alone with the mutilated bodies of my former bodyguards. My hip was aching from the pressure of my own body weight on my side, the dull throb growing into something sharp and unbearable.
Rocking back and forth in the chair as best I could, I managed to shift my weight back far enough so that the chair fell over until I was lying on my back.
I stared up at the ceiling, the smell of blood and death lingering in the air while my skin burned from the pull of the rope on my arms. My mind raced with anxiety as I contemplated everything that had just happened, everything I’d just learned. But I didn’t have time to process it all. Instead, I needed to take that information and do what I always did best.
Fucking plot.





35.

SHADOWS.









My body was on fire, my muscles preparing for blood and violence as I clenched and unclenched my fists. I was not normally accustomed to feeling fear, but the only time I ever truly felt it was when it concerned her.
And goddammit, it was the most gut-wrenching feeling in the world.
We had bypassed every single traffic law known to man to make it back to the hotel. But during those long fifteen minutes of making a hundred unanswered phone calls and rechecking unresponsive security systems, dread had successfully seeped its way into my bones.
Jaden.
I didn’t even wait for Scott to turn off the car before bolting from the passenger seat and heading for the elevator. The rest of the team barely made it in before the elevator doors shut behind them. As we ascended, I forced my heart rate to slow, filtering the adrenaline from my blood so I could focus on whatever the fuck I was about to walk into. And God help anyone who was left alive if they weren’t my fucking wife.
When I’d first learned that she had been shot all those months ago, I at least had the knowledge that she was alive and being treated. But right now, I had no fucking clue what to expect, and not knowing was the true silent

killer. I’d endure every gunshot wound I’d ever taken, every stabbing, every broken bone a hundred times over if it meant I never had to experience it again.
Stepping out of the elevator on the floor directly below mine, we quickly made our way up the secret stairwell that led into the suite. Guns drawn, I cracked the door open, my instincts on high alert at how dark and deadly quiet it was.
The power had been cut.
I silently pointed two fingers to the right, signaling for two men to check in that direction, and the rest with me. Moving quickly through the darkness of the hall, I kept my back against the wall as we scanned the suite, my eyes then landing on the dead bodies of three of my guards.
Fuck.
Why hadn’t any one of us received an alert from the security system?
Hurrying past them, I noticed their throats had all been slashed, which meant guns were avoided to keep things quiet. The bodies were still slightly warm, signaling that whatever had happened had not occurred too long ago.
Fuck.
Trekking swiftly through the shadows of the suite, my remaining team swept the rooms around me while my only focus stayed locked on finding Jaden. When I stepped into the dining room, the dim lights of street outside sparked an intense relief that suddenly slammed into me so hard it almost knocked me off my feet.
Halfway across the room, my gaze landed on Jaden, who was currently tied to a chair that had been tipped on its back, surrounded by death and destruction. She was attempting to chew at the knots of the rope that held her wrists to the arms of the chair.
I moved quickly, my eyes scanning in every direction for threats before I reached her and knelt, catching those sunken hazel eyes in her pale

bruised face. Lifting the chair, I righted it and carefully cut the rope away from her arms.
She rubbed her raw wrists while I studied her swollen and blemished face. My blood pressure shot through the fucking roof, my rage ready to hunt down and rip apart the walking corpses who were foolish enough to touch her.
“Are you hurt?” I asked, my voice barely containing my fury. She shook her head, but I knew better than to trust her answer.
Taking her in my hands, I assessed every inch of her, searching for potential injuries despite her annoyance and fussing. Once I ruled out any need for immediate medical attention, my hands gently took her face and pushed back her tangled hair so I could see her eyes without obstacle.
“What happened?” I asked. “Where are your bodyguards?”
All she did was sigh and nod to something behind me. Turning my head, I found two more bloodied bodies secured to chairs. Furious disappointment pulsed in my chest when I realized they belonged to Clive and Owen, the state of their corpses in the darkness making them barely recognizable.
Fucking jackasses.
Having seen enough, I lifted Jaden out of the chair and carried her through the destruction of the suite and into the bathroom, placing her on the countertop.
Removing her clothes, she sat with feigned patience as I assessed her again with deeper scrutiny and a flashlight now that I’d removed all her barriers. Relief was swift when I only found bruising and some scrapes, but I didn’t like that her skin was ice cold to the touch.
Turning on the bathtub faucet, I drew Jaden a warm bath and placed her in the tub, hoping the warm water would help her relax enough to tell me what the fuck had happened. I’d review the security footage later when things were back online, but right now, I wanted to know exactly what was going through her head while it was still fresh.

“Come on, Jaden. Come back to me,” I urged gently, massaging her small frozen hand in my own. “I need you to tell me what happened.”
She finally shook her head and released a deep slow breath.
“He just wanted information,” she murmured. “But I know nothing. So he made me watch him kill Clive and Owen for being a useless whore.”
Wrath like a volcanic eruption rumbled in my chest, the insult striking her deep enough to puncture even me.
“How many were there?”
She shrugged. “I don’t know. There were three left when I came to. I don’t know how many they started with. I think some ran off once I managed to steal the gun.”
I released my own slow deep breath to keep my rage down. Now was not the time to lose my shit. “What else?”
She shrugged again. “The power went out right before they attacked,” she continued. “We all tried to fight the best that we could, but we were outnumbered.”
I’d already taken note of the four unknown dead bodies I’d passed through the living room, not including the seven of my own. There had to have been more to launch that kind of a successful ambush.
“Then I woke up in that chair and got really lucky when he leaned in too close to me. I kicked him in the balls and managed to wrestle his gun from his hand with my legs, and then the chair tipped over. By the time he got up, I had the gun in my hand and scored two shots while the others disappeared. I lost track of time before you came in.”
Lucky was not a word I favored.
“Stay here. Do not get out of the tub,” I ordered and stood to leave.
Storming out of the bathroom and into the living room, I knelt and looked over each dead body that had been left behind.
“Armenians,” Scott said as he stepped back into the room. “Hired Armenians,” I added.

“Juan’s wife was Armenian.”
I stood and cracked the kink in my neck. “I know.”
Scott lifted his chin. “She okay?” he asked, nodding toward the bedroom.
I nodded solemnly, crossing my arms over my chest as images of what could have been flashed before my eyes. “She’s fine.”
“Good. Hopefully, she can fill in the blanks because we’ve got nothing. They cut the hardwire to the power. No alarms, no signal, no security footage.”
I pinched the bridge of my nose, releasing the growing tension in my forehead. This floor had an independent power source, so whoever it was had more information than they should.
FUCK.
“Jaden said she only saw three men when she woke, but there had to have been more. I had eight guards stationed here, including Clive and Owen. That should have been enough.”
Scott shook his head. “It doesn’t add up.”
No, it certainly fucking doesn’t.
“Matt was never at the docks,” I stated. “It had to have been a body double.”
“Sent to me to lure you away so they could, what, get to Jaden? Why?” I shook my head. “I don’t know. She said they wanted information, but
I’m not sure what kind yet. I’ll get more out of her later.”
“Do you think Matt was actually here?” Scott asked, his voice tight with suspicion.
I thought about it, and it was very possible, but it didn’t make sense. He wasn’t after Jaden. He was after Daniel. Why even bother with her? Unless he was still just trying to toy with me more, which also didn’t make sense since he lacked the time and resources.
I shook my head. “Jaden would have said so.”

Scott turned toward me. “You’re sure about that?” he asked, his tone cautious.
His doubt in her inflamed my already barely restrained wrath.
“After what I just did to her, she’d be pretty fucking stupid to make the same mistake twice,” I nearly growled.
Scott wisely stepped back. “Maybe she just didn’t see him.”
“Maybe. But it doesn’t make sense for him to goad me into coming here when he had no guarantee I would have even brought her with me.”
“Maybe he assumed you would bring her to the charity gala.”
Another maybe.
“Unless he found out later that she was here and took the opportunity. We arrived yesterday, so there would have been plenty of time to plan something,” he suggested.
“Opportunity to do what, exactly?” I pressed, crossing my arms as I walked about the trashed room in thought. “They didn’t take her or kill her, so what other advantage could she possibly give Matt that’s worth the risk or effort? She doesn’t know anything, and he knows this.”
Scott shrugged. “Who knows? He’s threatened Jaden before. Maybe he’s the one who sent the Armenians just to fuck with you. Or maybe they were supposed to kill her and failed.”
“Now that I could believe. But barely.” The reasoning still wasn’t strong enough to justify the risk of almost certain failure. Almost. “The same person who left me that message in Porto Rotondo has left me another, and it wasn’t just a coincidence. They had a hand in this.” I nodded to all the destruction around us.
“You think they’re working with Matt?”
My eyes glanced around the room, noticing all the shattered glass, broken furniture, and numerous bloodstains all over the place. The timing was too well planned not to be a collaboration.

I still had yet to determine the identity of this new enemy, my investigation in Vegas leading me absolutely nowhere. But I’d been too busy with other endeavors like two wars and a dead brother to avenge to give it any more attention than I could afford to.
My list of enemies was indefinite, and people added themselves to the list without me ever even knowing. But that was the nature of this business. You never really knew who you were going to inadvertently piss off.
“I don’t know, but they certainly aren’t working alone. Could be Matt, could be Miguel. Could be both for all I know.”
Scott cursed under his breath as he rolled his shoulders. “The enemy of my enemy bullshit…”
I sighed in agreement as I ran my hands through my hair.
“Whatever the reason, the purpose of tonight was clear. They wanted to get to Jaden, and they did,” I stated, my mind racing in far too many directions. “Whether or not they left empty-handed is another story we’ll have to sort out later. But right now, I need to take care of my wife.”
Scott nodded as he took out his phone. “What do you want me to do?”
I sighed again, rubbing the back of my neck to relieve some of the pressure. “Is Camaro still with her handlers?”
“Yeah. Do you want me to have her brought up?”
I released a small breath of relief and nodded. “As quickly as possible.”
If Jaden lost that damn dog, I’d never hear the end of it. As much of a pain in the ass Camaro was in keeping her cared for, she was worth it if she kept Jaden happy and occupied. That was, until the day she became a liability, and Jaden started risking her life to save her instead of the other way around.
“Focus on getting the power back on first. Then have the place cleaned and the bodies identified. I want a full report before Jaden wakes up tomorrow. And figure out what the hell else happened that led to our systems failure.”

Scott nodded at my request as I turned to head back into the bathroom to retrieve Jaden. But instead of storming right in like I imagined, I slowed to a stop to discreetly peer from behind the corner, watching her from outside the bathroom.
To my surprise, she’d actually remained in the tub like I told her to. But while her body obeyed, her mind rebelled from a thousand miles away. On the outside, she was catatonic. But on the inside, a storm was silently wreaking havoc within her heart.
My brand of vengeance was violent, cruel, and predictable. Hers? Yet to be defined.
And as much as I hated to admit it, that made her a very dangerous wild card.
One that needed to be recycled back into the deck as quickly as possible before it got out of hand.

SWAY.









The following morning was hard. My body was heavy with grief over the loss of Clive and Owen and the way they’d been taken from my life.
After everything I’d gone through with them, their loss unexpectedly left a weirdly shaped hole in my heart.
They were shitheads, but they were my shitheads.
I’d built a complicated relationship with them, one that I would never recreate with anyone else. But if things went according to plan in the next few days, none of it would even matter anyway.
The hard truth was there’d be no room for them in my life when I finally broke free of Darren’s grip. They likely wouldn’t have survived the fallout anyway. Hell, they would have likely followed Darren’s orders to the very end, no matter what I wanted.
At least it saved me from having to kill them myself, although I would have made it far less brutal, and much, much quicker. But my grief compared little to the pressure in my heart at the thought of my next incredibly time-sensitive challenge.
Convincing Darren to take me to the country estate.

Considering the trauma of what I had just gone through, I shouldn’t have any issues so long as I played the correct role.
Darren grilled me for nearly an hour last night, extracting as much information out of me as he could since the cameras had captured absolutely nothing last night, and I was the sole survivor.
I tried to stick as close to the truth as possible, voicing uncertainties due to the darkness, and performing the exact story I had rehearsed in my head for what felt like hours while waiting for Darren to return to the hotel.
At one point, I considered trying harder to get out of that damn chair, but I figured the image would benefit me if he saw me still in the midst of trying to escape, hoping for an emotional advantage.
And it must have worked for something because Darren made sure Camaro was with me during his interrogation, a gesture I took comfort in… until the moment I had to open my mouth.
With every lie I spoke, I heard the phantom lash of Darren’s belt striking my skin, the sickness of my betrayal shredding my stomach to ribbons. I could feel my throat literally start to close up at the memory of his hand wrapped around my neck, squeezing so hard I was sure death had finally come for me.
The more he questioned me, the more I could see the door of the basement creaking open in the back of my mind, threatening me with another round of horrors. Lying to him was now a terrifying act that was exhausting to conceal, yet somehow, I managed to pull it off. Or maybe I hadn’t, and Darren was just waiting for another opportune moment to crush my spirit again.
My demeanor had honestly been all over the place—angry, scared, bitter, confused, vengeful—it all had its place, and for now, Darren seemed satisfied with my answers, or lack thereof. My exhaustion had somehow granted me enough clemency to adjourn his investigation for the night. Who knew what he might ask me today.

You’d think Matt would have given me a little more to work with to corroborate my story, but if our plans were successful, then Darren wouldn’t have much time to act on my deceitfulness anyway. Because hopefully he’d be fucking dead, and I would be long gone.
I doubted I would even have to worry about Daniel coming after me. With Darren gone, it would probably be a lot easier for Matt to finally take him out.
Now, I just had to hope I was up for round two. But after what I accomplished with Darren last night and the other night at the club, I had faith in my abilities.
Considering my current disposition this morning, it wouldn’t require much effort.
Forcing myself from the bed, I cracked my neck and stretched my arms above my head, yawning away my exhaustion. Getting out of bed was the last thing I felt like doing, but it was already nearing 11:00 a.m., and I needed to show some strength today if I was going to achieve my goal.
Standing, I reached for my robe, slipping it on and making my way into the bathroom. After washing my face and brushing my teeth, I took a good look at myself in the mirror.
Scrapes, bruises, and massive swelling overwhelmed my face and neck, the weight of which left my skull feeling way too heavy. My hair was matted on one side, and my eyes were red and irritated. With the state of my being, I doubted it would be difficult to suspect me of anything but sincerity.
After brushing my hair until my arms hurt, I exited the bathroom and changed into a casual black tank top dress and then called Camaro from her bed to follow me out.
Moving down the hallway, I noticed that all the mess from earlier had been cleaned up and replaced. It was as if nothing had ever even happened. But the moment I stepped out of the hallway and into the sitting room, I

locked eyes with six guards standing very stiffly throughout the room. No one said a single word, the silence too awkward for my liking.
“Morning,” I said carefully to all of them, my tone more than apprehensive.
“Good morning, Mrs. Davis,” they all said in return.
My heart cracked slightly at the realization that my routine was going to change now that I was two bodyguards short. Depending on how soon Darren found my replacements, I would have to acclimate another pair to my lifestyle and shit-stirring attitude. And that would be a new source of frustration.
“So, uh, anyone know where Darren is?” I asked aloud.
“He’s on a phone call.” I saw Scott from the corner of my eye. He walked into the room and folded his arms across his chest as he leaned against the wall. “He’ll be in once he’s done. In the meantime, you should eat something.”
Ignoring Scott’s comment, I slowly padded through the room, stopping momentarily to catch the massive blood stains covering the carpet. The same spot where Clive and Owen had died. My stomach soured at the memory. They could clean up the mess everywhere else, but not the bloodstains in the carpet?
Biting back my bitterness, I rounded the stain and made my way toward the dining room table to find a wide spread of breakfast foods. I was interested in none of it.
Scott lingered in the corner of the room, his arms still tightly folded as he remained in the same position. I could feel his eyes on me as I placed some fruit on my plate and sat down. He was watching me way too closely for some reason.
Camaro went to her food bowl while I attempted to swallow down some grapes. No matter how many times Darren had tried, my stomach just wasn’t meant for massacres.

“You’re lucky to be alive, you know,” Scott remarked as he maneuvered slowly through the dining room.
I paused for a moment, caught off by his comment. “I’m aware,” I replied, keeping my eyes to myself as I focused on my plate.
“I’m actually pretty impressed that you managed to steal a gun while being tied to a chair, and firing off two fatal rounds without experiencing any return fire. And in the dark, no less. How the hell did you pull that off?” My stomach clenched as I reluctantly swallowed the grape I’d been chewing, making sure my movements were consistent and unbothered.
Scott was fishing, which meant he was not totally sold on my lies. And if he wasn’t certain, then neither was Darren.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
“Like you said, I got lucky. Unlike Clive and Owen,” I answered before taking a sip of my orange juice. It soured in my mouth almost immediately.
“Clearly,” he clipped.
“What did you do with their bodies?” I asked, tilting the conversation. “They were taken to an incinerator.”
I glanced back up at him. That was it? “Will they receive a burial?” Scott cocked a brow at my question. “No.”
“Why not?”
“Because we don’t honor failures,” he answered in the obvious.
I scoffed and rolled my eyes. “Will their families at least be notified?” Scott leveled me with a glare of annoyance. “They didn’t have families.
They were both orphaned felons who ran security for their gang leaders before they went to prison for the attempted murder of their rivals’ kids.”
Jesus.
I nodded solemnly at the history lesson. “They never told me about their past.”
“Nor should they have. The less you know about them, the better.”

“Whatever,” I replied before reluctantly swallowing another piece of fruit.
Two minutes of awkward silence later, I’d eaten all I could stand and stood from my seat.
“You know you need to eat more than that,” Scott reminded me.
A scowl immediately formed on my face. “Fuck off, Scott. Today is not the day.”
He tsk’d. “Darren won’t be happy.”
“When is he ever?” I growled, bypassing him for the huge-ass outdoor patio while Camaro ran to catch up to my side.
Plopping down on the outdoor carpet, I pulled Camaro down to sit with me. I ignored Scott as he took a seat against the wall about twenty feet away. Apparently, he was the resident babysitter today.
“Come here, pretty girl,” I cooed to my dog. “You smell so nice and clean.”
Wrapping my arms around my Rottie, I shivered at the thought that I had almost lost her last night. I’d never been more grateful for her excessive grooming schedule.
If I had to watch my dog die too, I didn’t know what I would do, but it certainly wouldn’t involve letting Matt leave alive, rescue mission or no rescue mission. Camaro was the closest thing I had to a friend right now and the only one I could find comfort in.
For the next hour, all my brain would allow me to do was endure a playback of everything that had happened last night and everything I needed to do now. I’d witnessed a lot of brutal murders and torture over the years, but I don’t think any of them had been as painful to watch as Clive’s and Owen’s.
Shuddering, I hugged Camaro closer, and a single stupid tear found its way down my cheek.
“You didn’t finish your breakfast,” Darren said sternly from behind me.

Quickly swiping the tear away, I turned to find him towering over me, his hands in his pockets and a look of disappointment on his face. His eyes darkened as he caught my tear.
“You better not be crying over them,” he warned, his gaze narrowing.
I scowled up at him. “Don’t you dare scold me for it!” I growled, boldly pointing my finger at him. “They may not have been my favorite people, but they didn’t deserve to go down like that. I don’t care what you say!”
Darren sighed, his jaw tightening as he folded his arms across his chest. “You should have known better than to form attachments with the men
whose job it is to literally die for you. They failed you last night. And there are consequences to failure.”
I scoffed at his dismissal. “Except they did die for me, Darren. I’m alive, and they’re both dead because of it. A job well done, don’t you think?”
He shook his head. “No. The other part of their job is to keep you safe,” he retorted. “That was their biggest failure.”
“They did their best,” I argued, annoyance lacing my voice.
“And it wasn’t good enough, not to my standards,” he snapped. “Even if they had survived last night, they would not have survived me, and you know it.”
I whipped my head around to glare up at him. “Yeah? And just where the fuck were you the whole time, huh? After you so viciously flaunted that joke of a charity gala in my face like some kind of asshole, where did you run off to, huh? To go kill some poor girl who was lucky enough to escape your trade? Maybe if you had been here instead of pursuing her, we would have had a better chance at fighting—”
“You had better watch your mouth, princess,” he warned, his voice silencing mine with his terrifying lethal tone. “Loose ends cannot be ignored. I expect you to understand this by now.”

I turned away, unwilling to entertain his bullshit. “I do understand. And I hate you for it.” The memory of the helpless panic I’d felt knowing what he was going to do, and that there was nothing I could do about it was another ghost that haunted me. She would haunt me, and the guilt would eat at me forever.
Darren tilted his head back and sighed in frustration, but we both knew my hatred was of no consequence to him. He usually found it amusing.
“I made it quick, Jaden,” he said gently.
I scoffed harshly. The minor detail acknowledging his act was of no help at all.
“If that’s the case, then why did it take you so long to return, huh? You were in the same damn building for fuck’s sake. Where the hell were you?”
Hey dumbass, this isn’t getting you any closer to the country estate.
I could feel the heat emanating off his body as I stupidly pressed him for answers I had no business requesting. But I was angry for what he had done to that girl, and I wanted him to feel some form of regret for choosing to make her murder his priority instead of me.
And then suddenly, that hamster in my head started to sprint in that little metal wheel of hers.
If I could inspire just enough guilt, then maybe I could hustle some very important time-sensitive restitution…
“I’m not going to warn you again, little girl. You damn well know better than to ask me that,” he practically snarled, his eyes flashing with the promise of violence.
Little girl.
Darren always liked to remind me of how small I was compared to him when I pushed him too far. And the subtle advisement to shut my mouth before he did it for me usually did the trick. But right now, I refused to let him off the hook that easily and turned up the hysterics.

“You chose her over me!” I shrieked. “And I almost died because of it! I deserve a fucking explanat—”
I didn’t finish my sentence before I was suddenly yanked up from the floor and into Darren’s arms, my legs swinging up as he moved to one of the sun chairs.
Lying back against it, he settled me over his lap to straddle his hips, pulling my front against his chest so my cheek was resting against his shoulder.
I fully expected him to berate me, but only a sigh left his lungs, the sound heavy with grief and audible reluctance as he gently ran his palm up and down my back.
“You’re right,” he finally admitted, shocking me completely. “I should have been there, and I wasn’t.” I felt myself stiffen at his admission, taken completely off guard. Was he actually admitting to fault? “However, the empire I’ve built cannot guarantee your safety if I don’t defend it against even the slightest of threats that could jeopardize it. That is the nature of this life, and try as I might, I cannot always be around to protect you. Which is why I’ve taken such extreme measures to ensure your safety, and so far, only one of them has proven to maintain a 100 percent success rate.”
I grunted in response. “What’s that, locking me away all the time?” I added sarcastically, my tone unamused.
“No. It was training you,” he answered pointedly. Pausing internally, I suddenly felt compelled to sit up and look him in the eye for this one, sure I had heard him wrong. But he continued unfazed. “You’ve managed to save yourself without me or anyone else’s help more times than I’d like to remember, and I owe that to your ability to strategically utilize everything I’ve taught you.” Wait. Was he…was he actually acknowledging my capabilities? First, I’m right, and now I’m skilled? What the hell is happening? “This is going to go straight to your pretty little head, but you’ve turned out to be quite the little protégé,” he snarked. “I’m actually

very proud of all you’ve managed to do by yourself, even if it doesn’t seem like it.”
Protégé…wow.
I dipped my chin, leveling him with a serious expression, remembering something he had once forced me to choke on not too long ago. “But not enough to admit I don’t actually need you to survive anymore.”
The energy from his body turned dark, his eyes brewing with a storm that promised so much degradation for that bold little comment. Slowly, he leaned forward from his seat, causing me to slightly lean away as he captured more of my space.
“I would never be so bold as to presume such a foolish claim,” he nearly growled, the deep timbre of his voice matching the intensity of his gaze. “And I am not willing to taunt it so recklessly.”
I couldn’t mistake the double innuendo if I tried. But he was right. I was reckless, and stubborn, and foolish, and fresh out of fucks to give for any of it. And my ability to still meet him eye for eye said it all, the curl of my lips deviously unapologetic.
“I honestly thought hell would freeze over before you finally gave me even just a crumb of validation,” I replied.
“Feeding your ego is counterproductive. I push you as hard as I do for a reason.”
“Well, I’m glad to know I’m at least finally worthy of your acknowledgment,” I said, my tone taking on a sarcastic lilt.
He nodded. “Yes, and now that I have inflated your ego, I’m afraid I’m going to have to deflate it.”
I frowned at him. “What do you mean?” I nearly screeched, tilting my head. “Don’t backtrack now! Not when my praise kink is nearly satisfied.”
Darren shook his head. “You are such a fucking brat,” he scorned, rolling his eyes, but entertained my humor anyway. “Leaving you satisfied

in that demand would devastate the cause of keeping you striving for my approval. So if that’s what you’re after, then this next leap should be easy.”
I cocked a brow at him. “What are you talking about?”
He took his hands and wrapped them around my hips, clutching me tightly. “You need to understand that things are about to change. And all that validation I just gave you needs to be packed away along with your pride because as this war escalates, I expect your survival strategies to adapt accordingly.”
Pushing aside my irritation, I considered my words carefully, vying for the right opportunity to present itself.
“What the hell is it you want me to do?”
Darren’s gaze was hard, his eyes so intense it made me fight a shiver from erupting up my spine.
“I need you to keep yourself safe.”
I rolled my eyes at the obvious. “That’s usually my first objective.” “No, it isn’t. When your fight or flight gets triggered, you always
choose fight. And I am telling you to choose the latter.”
I cocked a brow, surprised by this new demand. “You want me to run?” “Yes. Run. Hide. Don’t look back.”
“That’s pretty counterproductive, don’t you think?”
He shook his head. “I can’t focus on the fight if I don’t know whether or not you’re safe. So from now on, your objective is to accomplish that. Get yourself to a secure location and stay there until I come for you. Is that understood?”
I jerked back in utter disbelief. What the fuck! After gifting me with those hearty breadcrumbs of sweet, sweet validation, he wanted me to just dump it all in the trash and hide like some fucking mouse?
After everything I had endured, now I was expected to just sit the fight out, shelter and hide like a good little girl? Fuck that.

“You want me to hide until you come get me? What if you never come?
What am I supposed to do then?”
His eyes blazed like I had insulted him. Hooking his two fingers under my collar, he jerked me forward. “I will always come for you. Never doubt that, Jaden. Ever.”
I groaned, irritation burrowing at my temples. “Okay, but what good will hiding do when you literally just said that the only measure with a 100 percent success rate has been me.”
“So far,” he clipped, steeling his tone as he released me. “That doesn’t mean it’s the primary method of defense. It’s the last resort.” I scoffed at his reasoning, looking away to focus on anything else other than his stupid face. “I’m not arguing with you about this, Jaden. There will be serious consequences if I find out you disobeyed me and stuck around to fight instead of actively trying to flee. Do not test me on that.” When I refused to look at him, he took my chin between his fingers and pulled my gaze back to his. “Say you understand,” he ordered, his voice hard and uncompromising.
I huffed an agitated breath as I stared him down. This conversation was not going in the direction I had planned. But if I stayed true to my goal and redirected, then none of this would even fucking matter anyway. So there was no reason to get upset about it.
“Fine,” I grumbled. “I understand.”
“Good,” he replied, releasing my chin. “I can’t afford to have you at risk all the time.”
I tilted my head, frowning slightly. “Are you anticipating more attacks while we’re away from home?” I asked carefully.
“You should always anticipate an attack, no matter where we are.
Especially when we’re at war.”
“I do, but that makes for a very exhausting life, you know.” “It’s the life we live,” he declared.

Or the life one of us was forced to live.
“Fine, then how much longer are we staying here? I can only stand to see the bloodstains on the carpet from Clive and Owen for so long.”
Darren groaned, a flash of agitation in his eyes. “You weren’t supposed to see that. I specifically ordered for it to be covered up before you woke up.”
“Well, it wasn’t.”
His eyes swung over to Scott’s, glancing at him with a silent, but fierce displeasure.
“I’ll take care of it,” Darren affirmed, and I suddenly wondered if that meant he intended to add to the stain before having it removed. I seriously hoped not. I’d seen enough of what he does to people who fuck up around me, and I didn’t want to contribute to it anymore. Unless it would somehow work in my favor. “We won’t be here much longer,” he added. “The jet is being prepared as we speak.”
I sighed in disappointment, resting my head back down on his shoulder, snuggling in close for dramatic effect. “I was really looking forward to this change of scenery.”
Darren exhaled, rubbing his hand up and down my arm softly.
“I know. But I want you home where it’s safe, so I can focus on what I need to do.”
I groaned, tired of everything revolving around keeping my stupid ass “safe” when I had other reckless motives to push. The thought of actually going back to the estate already made me physically ill.
“Does it have to be that home? Can’t we stay at one of the other ones?
Just for a little while?” And just like that, my heart already skipped a beat.
Darren sighed greatly, the weight of my request difficult for him to ignore after this weekend’s epic failure. But I knew my simple complaint would be enough to at least get the wheels turning in his head. After a moment’s pause, he finally spoke again.

“Which one?” he asked, his tone hard and serious, like he was mad at himself for giving in and entertaining my silly whims.
His question made me think back to my working days during settlement negotiations. You usually demanded as much as you could, which was most often much more than what the case was actually worth to get the realistic amount in the end. The same could easily be applied to just about any scenario.
“How about the one in Anchorage? I could finally do some snowboarding,” I suggested.
Darren immediately scoffed like I’d hoped he would. “I am not flying out to fucking Alaska right now, especially from Chicago. Try again.”
I feigned my disappointment with a huff.
“Well, aside from the yacht and private island, the only other place I know of is the country estate. And that isn’t much for a change of scenery.”
My stomach instantly plummeted at the mention of my deception, the treachery splintering through my spine like thorns growing on a rose stem. I hated how he had successfully conditioned me to feel so much fear from lying that my body would physically punish itself whenever I did. And here I had done it twice now in the last twelve hours.
Darren scratched the side of his jaw, silently deliberating to himself while I tried not to hold my breath.
“No, but it would be a lot closer,” he mused.
My eyes quickly wandered away to focus my anxiety on something else to soothe it, Camaro being the next best thing. “I’d honestly settle for anything at this point,” I added, absentmindedly. “But I guess it would be nice to see the horses again.”
Darren was quiet as he mulled over the options, the easiest of which was just to tell me no like he usually did. When he said nothing, I wrapped my arms around his neck and gently pressed my forehead to his.

Running my hands down his chest, he sucked in a slow deep breath, a low hum of appreciation rumbling up his throat as he nudged his head against mine.
“Please,” I whispered, my voice desperately sweet while my stomach secretly ate itself alive.
Pulling away, he met my gaze, the sharpness of his stare cutting me deep, making me fear he could see right down to the core of my scheme.
“And what do I get in return for doing this enormous gesture for you?”
I leaned in close, a smirk hot on my lips. “How about I fight you for it?” Darren huffed a short laugh, a dark chuckle rolling from his throat. I didn’t miss the quick flash of heated desire that flickered across his deep
blue eyes, the promise of a rough afternoon headed my way.
Clutching my waist, Darren swiftly stood, taking my weight with him without effort. Planting my bare feet on the floor, his hands cupped my face as he leaned down to kiss me. I moaned into his lips, letting him feel what would be my impassioned gratitude, and praying he wouldn’t notice the tremble in my spine.
Releasing my mouth, he pinned my gaze in place, that deep blue swallowing me whole while his thumbs rubbed along my cheeks.
“Alright,” he finally said. “Be ready to leave in an hour.”
And with that, he turned away and headed back into the suite, Scott waiting for him at the door. For a split second, Scott’s gaze locked with mine, a strange look in his eye before he turned away to follow Darren back inside.
I dismissed it just as quickly, far too busy keeping my elation and surmounting panic to myself. Because holy shit, I had actually done it. Again.
Hook. Line. And fucking sinker.
Now, I just had to make sure we stayed there for the next three days.





37.

DRIVE.



The jet landed an hour ago, and my body was vibrating like I was still inside it, my nerves rattling me to the core. Everything inside me hummed with anticipation knowing what I had miraculously managed to do
—line us up for a full-scale combative assault. My mind was running up the walls with ideas of what could happen in the next few days.
Destruction.
Death.
Freedom?
Maybe. It seemed way too easy. Could I really just bench myself and assume that everything would go according to plan? Fuck no. I wasn’t going to let anyone fuck this operation up. I had to be there to make sure the agenda was met. Hell, maybe I’d finally get the chance to kill Darren myself if the opportunity presented itself.
No one would give a fuck about me if they thought Darren had been killed from all the fighting. I could just quietly disappear, especially since Darren had just told me that was exactly what I was supposed to do now anyway.
But what if Jason was planning on engaging in the fight? Matt couldn’t confirm if he was, so there was only a chance that Jason would be there. Although I couldn’t imagine Jason would want to sit out on any operation

that would lead to my rescue. He’d want to be right in the middle of it. So that was where I would be. Front and center.
And then I would find him.
My plan decided, I figured I would need to take the edge off and have some fun with my dog before the shit finally hit the fan. I needed something to distract me before my anxiety literally ripped me apart. But as I got closer to the back parlor, I overheard Darren speaking to someone with enough aggression to make me halt in my tracks.
“What the fuck are you talking about, Daniel?” Darren growled, his elevated voice making me cringe back against the wall.
“I don’t know how it happened, but as of this morning, the money is gone,” a voice said from what sounded like a cell phone. Daniel’s voice, I suspected.
“How the fuck is that even possible?” Darren growled. “Still trying to figure that out.”
“Were you monitoring the system? Watching the accounts?” Scott asked.
“Of course, I was!” Daniel shouted back. “But then…” “But what?!”
An audible sigh full of exhaustion and hesitation filled the air. “Toward the end of the night, one of the buyers got sick in the viewing room. He was throwing up blood all over the place and then started seizing on the floor. He fucking died. And the whole thing probably cost us about twenty minutes to assess if we were all next or if it was just Ronald. It could just be a coincidence but considering what happened with you around the same time, I’m just not sure.”
Sighs, groans, and curses quickly overwhelmed the room, Daniel still trying to shout over everyone to quiet them down.
“Look, I don’t know how they managed to hack our auction last night, but they did. We’re doing everything we can to handle it.”

Holy shit. Someone hacked Darren’s auctions? I didn’t know if he was referring to the one I’d been a part of or if this was something different, but either way, this was huge.
Darren sighed with frustration. “Fucking hell. We’re going to have to rebuild a whole new security system.”
“It’s already being prepared, and Anton and his team are working around the clock to figure out what happened,” Scott added.
“Good. I want to be informed the second they know something,” Darren said.
Carefully backtracking into the hallway, my mind raced over what it all meant. Whoever managed to circumvent that firewall had to be one hell of a hacker to pull that off.
Matt hadn’t mentioned anything about the auction or any other plans, but it wouldn’t surprise me if he had found a way to disrupt it. I wondered what kind of implications this would have.
An approaching guard had me moving my feet again, back into the room as if I hadn’t heard a damn thing. Grabbing a Frisbee out of Camaro’s toy trunk in the sunroom across the hall, I quickly headed for the door leading into the backyard.
“Where do you think you’re going?” Darren’s hard voice came from the parlor.
Ah, fuck.
Stopping in place, I turned my head to find him sitting at a large round table with Scott and four other men, weapons and maps laid out all across the surface. Clearly, Daniel had hung up.
“I was just going to play with Camaro outside for a bit,” I answered innocently. “Maybe go see the horses if Camaro can keep her shit together.” Last time had been a total fucking disaster, and I did not need a repeat of that.
Darren studied me for a moment, his eyes darkening with disapproval.

“No,” he said dismissively, and turned his attention back to the maps and papers on the table.
I stood there stunned.
No?
“What? Why the hell not?”
He didn’t even acknowledge me with a response. Just continued his discussions like I was no longer there.
I continued to stand in the doorway, slightly dumbfounded at Darren’s quick dismissal. My thoughts shifted to the last time I had argued with him after being denied outside access.
It hadn’t gone well for me then, and my fear of the basement was still affecting my confidence, especially when my arsenal was low on ammunition for reasoning or emotion for the occasion. Darren was clearly already in a bad mood, and my wants were childish at best.
I almost considered turning away to sulk in the library when Sid’s voice suddenly snuck into my head.
Drive the fucking car, Jaden.
I could feel my shoulders squaring up as liquid steel started to straighten my spine. I drove that fucking car the other night when I fucked him in that club. I drove that fucking car when I manipulated him this morning into taking me here. And now, I would damn well drive it again.
Placing the Frisbee down on the nearby couch, I carefully made my way over to him, noticing how his eyes stayed planted on the maps while two of the men continued their conversation with Scott. When I was close enough, I slowly wrapped my arms around Darren’s shoulders and leaned my mouth to his ear.
“Please,” I whispered, my plea coming off as sweet and sultry as I could manage. I felt his shoulders tense while his back leaned into my chest. “A change of scenery doesn’t really help when you’re still stuck inside.” My hands traveled over his muscled shoulders and across the expanse of his

chest, my touch slow and deliberate. “And I’ve been cooped up for so long,” I drawled, letting my breath tickle the back of his ear and along his neck. I watched as his right hand clenched into a tight fist, his chest expanding into my touch.
“A storm is coming,” he finally said. “I don’t want you getting caught in the middle of it.”
He had no fucking idea.
“I know, and it’s supposed to last the entire rest of the day. This is my only shot,” I pleaded. He grunted his disapproval of my reasoning, but I wasn’t giving up yet. “Please?” I sang, emphasizing the gloom in my voice. “I promise I won’t go too far. After last night, I really need the air. Just for a little while?”
A heavy exaggerated sigh finally escaped his lips, and I knew I had won.
“Fine, fuck it,” he growled and looked toward Scott. “Put Emmett and Luther on her while she’s outside. She’s got one hour, then I want her back inside.”
One hour was too short, but I would take what I could earn.
“Thank you,” I said quietly so only he could hear and turned for the door.
Darren abruptly stood from his chair, catching my wrist and hauled me back over to him, making my stomach clench as his massive frame towered over mine. Each muscle of his body was so sharply defined through his black dress shirt, the sleeves rolled to his elbows to expose that beautiful eagle tattoo on his forearm.
The man was designed for ruin, reminding me of all the terrifying things he was capable of, and how it would all come to fruition in less than seventy-two hours. Taking my face in both his hands, he leaned down and pressed a firm kiss to my lips, the heat of his body making mine melt right into him.

“One hour,” he reminded me as he pulled away. “No fuss.”
I blinked up at him. “Okay, no fuss. Byeee!” I said quickly and scampered around him before he could keep me there any longer.
I grabbed the Frisbee from the couch and called Camaro to follow me out the door. Heading out to the wide-open backyard, I released a massive breath of relief, and then held up the Frisbee for Camaro to see.
“You want it?” I asked playfully.
When she barked and jumped up on her hind legs, I flicked my wrist and sent the Frisbee through the air and across the yard. Like the speeding bullet she was, Camaro raced after the Frisbee, jumped into the air and caught it right between her teeth.
“Good girl!” I shouted, clapping to encourage her to bring the Frisbee back for another toss. Glancing up at the sky, I took note of the gray clouds rolling in and the dark blue ones far off in the distance. And damn if I didn’t love a good storm.
Watching Camaro run, I felt the two new shadows creep up behind me. They remained a respectable fifty feet away, but they were not the comfort I usually got when Clive and Owen were around.
We played like that back and forth for a little while, Emmett and Luther watching from the shade of the patio, looking bored and brooding all over the place.
I’d ask them if they wanted to play too, but I doubted I’d even get a response. It was hard to blame them, though. Not many people ever dared to interact with me for good reason.
Deciding to send Camaro on a good run, I tossed the Frisbee hard into the air, sending it high into the sky and catching the wind. The gust sent the Frisbee far right, and Camaro chased it even after it changed directions until it smacked right into the face of one of the guards.
Oops.

The second guard he’d been patrolling with laughed hysterically as Camaro tackled him to the ground to retrieve the Frisbee stuck in his jacket.
Giggling to myself, the rest of the patrolling guards laughed at the scene as the poor guard finally shot up from the ground, yanking the Frisbee out of Camaro’s reach. The dark expression on his face made it clear he was not as amused as everyone else.
“Sorry about that!” I shouted, hoping he wouldn’t stay too mad about it. I mean, he did literally walk right into it. For a guard, that was some piss- poor situational awareness.
Catching my apology, he looked back at me with the meanest scowl on his face and then yelled something at Camaro. He then whipped his arm back and tossed the Frisbee all the way into the damn lake, turning to finally wave and smile at me as Camaro ran straight for the water.
The sound of her jumping from the dock to the splash of the water made me glare back at him. She literally just had a bath the other night.
Marching past his post to retrieve my dog, I scowled back at him. “Thanks a lot, asshole,” I growled at him.
“Oops!” he replied sarcastically, making me want to throat punch him with the butt of his rifle.
Ignoring him, I didn’t even make it to the dock before Camaro started barking and whining like I’d never heard before. My eyes scanning the lake, I found her in a patch of floating weeds, the Frisbee long abandoned and floating away.
She yelped as she struggled to paddle forward, getting absolutely nowhere as the seaweed growing up from the water tangled under her legs.
Panic seized my heart as I watched my dog struggle to free herself, bobbing up and down in the water and barking, seemingly only making the tangles worse.
“Camaro!” I shouted in panic, racing down the dock and diving straight into the water.

I could hear Luther and Emmett angrily shouting my name, but I ignored them as I powered through the water. Fuck them. I would not sit back and watch my dog drown.
Camaro continued to bark and struggle against the weeds that held her back and I could see her panic turning frantic. I heard two loud splashes behind me, sure that Emmett and Luther had jumped in after me. If that was what it took to mobilize them then fine, maybe they could be of some actual use.
I reached Camaro within a few seconds of my initial dive, grabbing her collar to get her to stop twisting herself and calm down. With the water being too deep for me to touch, I struggled to keep Camaro contained while she scratched the shit out of my arms.
Quickly tugging away the floating weeds that she’d somehow tangled herself in, I struggled to hold her head above the water while simultaneously kicking to keep myself afloat. She was already starting to tire, her hind legs faltering to keep her up as her lower body started to sink.
“Mrs. Davis!” Emmett yelled at me as they both swam toward me. “What the fuck!”
“She’s stuck in the seaweeds! Get your knife out!”
Apparently, the water wasn’t as deep as I thought because as soon as those fuckers got here they were able to stand with the water stopping just at their chins while my ass was still kicking to stay afloat.
“Move,” Emmett ordered as he pulled out his knife and cut the seaweed while Luther took over my hold of Camaro to keep her from going anywhere and making it worse. As soon as the seaweed was cut, I pulled them away from her while Luther gripped the scruff of Camaro’s neck and held her lower body up as he guided her back to the dock.
“Let’s go,” Emmett said with a disgruntled sigh and pulled me to start swimming back for the dock.

Now that I was coming down from the adrenaline rush, I suddenly became aware of how cold the water really was … or maybe the chill came when I noticed Darren heading toward us from the house. Dread immediately seeped into my stomach.
Goddamnit.
When I reached the dock, I gripped the edge and pulled myself up. Water instantly sloshed everywhere and soaked the wood under my soggy, drenched shoes. Keeping my shoulders squared, I watched Camaro shake the water from her fur, spraying Luther and making me smirk. At least she was okay.
Patting my dog in relief, I started to make my way back up the dock, water dripping from my hair and clothes. I was sure I looked my absolute finest right now.
When Darren’s eyes landed on me, his gaze went cold, fury igniting his features as he stopped at the dock.
“What the hell just happened?” he asked, his voice tight with anger as he looked me up and down.
“Camaro got caught in some seaweed fetching a Frisbee. I jumped in to help her.”
His eyes narrowed, that stern jaw of his clenching with rage as he stared me down.
“Why was she in the water in the first place?”
“Because dumb-fuck McGee over there decided to throw it straight into the lake,” Luther spoke up, pointing at the guard who now stood several feet away from us with three other guards.
Darren turned to look at the guard Luther had pointed at, and the man went so stiff I thought he was going to faint. The rest of the surrounding guards said nothing as they watched, grateful they weren’t the ones catching their boss’s deadly attention.

“Is that true?” Darren asked the guard, his voice barely holding back his agitation.
The guard’s face went visibly white as he stood there completely motionless. “Well, I didn’t think—”
One swift movement was all Darren made before a gunshot rang out through the air and the guard fell dead to the ground with a bullet wound in his forehead. I barely even flinched. I swore at least one person died around me every day.
“And the two of you let her jump in?” Darren continued, gun still in hand as he turned to address Emmett and Luther, the other guard now completely forgotten.
“Jesus Christ, Darren, it’s not like I was drowning or something. I know how to swim for fuck—” His giant hand struck out like a fucking whip, grasping the entire lower half of my face to cut me off mid-sentence, and yanking me to his chest.
“Not another word,” he warned before turning his heated gaze back to Emmett and Luther.
“We went after her as soon as she bolted,” Emmett said in their defense. “How far away were you?” Darren asked, unbothered by my incessant struggle as I tried to pry his hand off my damn face. The thing was a
fucking vise.
“About fifty feet,” Luther replied.
“From now on it’s twenty feet until I say otherwise.”
I groaned my objection to his sudden declaration, shoving at his chest to release my face so I could at least breathe properly.
The glare I received from him had me quickly rethinking my strategy. “You’re soaking wet, that water is over your head, and there are scratches all over your arms and shoulder,” Darren scolded as he looked me up and down.

“So?!” I muffled through my still trapped mouth as I glared right back at him. I’d survived so much fucking worse just last night. It was comical to think otherwise.
Finally releasing my face, I took a huge step back and rubbed my now achy jaw but kept my eyes level with his.
“I have enough shit going on, Jaden. I don’t need to add worrying about you creating trouble in my own backyard to that list,” he rumbled, holstering his gun behind his back.
I almost punched him. “Then train your guards to be more respectful of my activities and maybe a little more attentive of their surroundings. None of this would have happened if he hadn’t walked right into an airborne Frisbee,” I argued, pointing at the freshly dead guard still laid out on the grass.
“None of this would have happened if you had stayed inside like I told you to,” Darren countered, stepping farther into my space to crowd me.
My neck strained just to continue matching his gaze, his giant stature swallowing up not only my space but my entire fucking body, and with each inch he claimed, I felt myself growing more and more agitated.
I scowled in response. “I was not about to sit back and watch my dog drown.”
Darren’s jaw tensed again, that dark blue gaze reminding me of who I was arguing with. “I have half a mind to have that damn dog removed. She’s starting to be more trouble than she’s worth, and I won’t have that, Jaden.”
My eyes widened in shock, panic and fury igniting my entire body until a surge of adrenaline suddenly shot through my veins. This motherfucker just threatened my fucking dog!
I didn’t know what came over me. Maybe it was all the pent-up anxiety. Maybe my brain short-circuited. But in an instant, all my fear and wifely decorum instantly vanished, and I just…lunged.

Bolting forward, I wrapped my arms around Darren’s waist and shoved my shoulder into his hip, knocking him back and forcing us both off the dock and straight into the lake. Water splashed everywhere as we sank together, landing in the shallow area that was thankfully only about two feet deep.
A series of “oh shits” circulated the air, the remaining guards still watching from a safe distance, wisely refraining from intervening.
Maneuvering myself as we fell, I twisted my body so that I landed on top of Darren’s chest and gripped the collar of his shirt in my hands, yanking him to me.
“Don’t you dare touch my fucking dog! Do you hear me!?” I roared down at him. “You lay one fucking hand on her, and I swear to God, you will never know another restful night again because I will kill you in your fucking sleep!” I shouted at him, my rage matching his own as I stared him down.
I didn’t know what I expected in return from him, but it certainly wasn’t the look he was currently wearing. A flash of shock had reflected in his eyes when we landed in the water, but after my threats had been unleashed, it was quickly replaced with a softened expression and curled lips.
I recognized the look almost immediately, and it made me want to instantly punch him in the mouth. Because that was the look he usually displayed when he thought I was being the most adorable thing he’d ever seen. And it made me growl, knowing he never took my threats seriously.
A soft chuckle reverberated behind his closed lips, my first sign of incoming retribution. “You are just. So. Damn. Cute,” he sneered, barely shaking his head. And then his expression suddenly changed, turning completely blank, and I felt a small spike of fear in the pit of my stomach.
Before I could register what was happening, Darren had flipped us, his body trapping mine under the water while both his hands held my head just above the surface. The position made me feel way too vulnerable, fearful

that fighting him like this would be a terrible idea, and he knew that. Bastard.
His piercing gaze held mine in place, my body still as stone while my heart raced like a damn thoroughbred. His voice was low, quiet enough for only the two of us to hear, but the warning in his tone was enough to cool down the rage burning in my chest.
“I’ll admit, that was a nice tackle,” he said, pride lingering in his eyes. “But if you ever pull something like that again in front of my men, I will punish you so harshly you’ll never be this confident in their presence again. Do you understand?”
It took me several breaths before I could answer, the frigid chill of the water stealing my voice. “Y-yes,” I whispered on an exhale.
“Good girl. Now kiss me.”
Tilting my head, I begrudgingly pressed my lips to his, giving him the surrender he clearly wanted me to display. Taking advantage, I could taste the smile on his lips as his tongue plundered my mouth, his fingers gripping my jaw to claim more of his territory.
Releasing my mouth, he tilted my face to force me to look at him. “I won’t touch your dog, but understand that she is only yours for as long as I allow it. Camaro needs to be an asset, not a liability. Consider this your one and only warning.”
I had nothing to say to that…because I knew he wasn’t wrong. He could do whatever he wanted, take whatever he wanted, and the most I could do about it was act out my tantrum and proceed to pout for the rest of my life. But even with this acceptance, I didn’t regret a single word.
“I. Said. What. I. Said.”
Darren rolled his eyes and released a heavy breath, his mouth forming the tiniest hint of a smirk as he released my face. “So you did. And now we both need a shower,” he commented.

He then placed his hands under my arms to lift me out of the water and then threw me over his shoulder. Groaning aloud in protest, Darren walked our soaking-wet bodies out of the lake, past the awkwardly silent guards, and down the lawn back toward the house.
“Stau,” Darren commanded in Romanian just as Camaro was getting ready to follow.
I sighed in disappointment as I turned my gaze up to the sky, catching the quick strikes of lightning that burst through the clouds in the far distance. And suddenly, I felt inspired again.





38.

SOME HELL.









Storming through our bedroom door, I tossed Jaden’s soaking-wet ass onto the bed, smirking as she rolled with the momentum onto the other
side and planted her feet on the floor.
“I’m suddenly in the mood for a little brat taming,” I announced as I stretched my neck, moving farther into the room.
Jaden’s eyes locked with mine, a look of unease draped across her pretty face as she watched me remove my guns from their holsters and place them on the nightstand, along with my conveniently waterproof phone.
But when her gaze followed my hands to unbutton my wet shirt, I knew her body was already preparing for all the things I planned to do to it.
After that little display by the lake, actually knocking me off the fucking dock the way she did, it was clear my little hellcat had returned much faster than I had anticipated. Either she was getting better at compartmentalizing her trauma or I was losing my touch.
Either way, I was suddenly eager to play.
The shirt stuck to my skin as I pulled it away and chucked it to the floor, droplets of water still clinging to my bare chest. Jaden’s hands were buried

in the sheets of the bed for stability, her small frame locked in place as she waited for my next move.
But I wasn’t the type to rush these kinds of events, at least not with her. I wanted to drag them out for as long as possible, savoring every second of what I could draw from her, no matter what it was.
Moans, threats, punches, pleasure—I’d take it all and then some until she had nothing left to give.
“Come here,” I ordered.
And like a shift in the air, the wind changed course and Jaden’s entire mentality switched from the guarded queen to the prey I craved to hunt and conquer. It was like watching someone split between personalities right in front of you, utterly fascinating.
“No,” she clipped.
A savage grin morphed on my face. Noticing her limbs beginning to slacken, her muscles loosened in anticipation of my familiar brand of brutality headed her way. It had barely been over a week since the basement and her bravery had come back with a vengeance. She was such a damn good girl.
“You have until the count of three,” I informed her, slipping off my wet shoes and socks. “Before I fucking break you in half.”
She sucked in a deep breath, her shoulders rising with the motion, then rolling them back down before straightening and steeling her spine. Jaden had that adorable look of fierce determination shadowing her face, her gaze sharpening to a lethal edge I couldn’t wait to taste.
“One,” I said, rolling my own shoulders, letting my heated blood rush through me.
She didn’t move. “Two.”
The single word punctured the air, a final warning that caused Jaden to flinch. It brought a smile to my face as I stared her down, cracking my neck

and expelling some of the built-up pressure. Jaden opened her palms at her sides, stretching her fingers out wide, as if any of it would make one bit of a damn difference. She was fucked either way. Like always.
“Three.”
I moved faster than she could blink, barely granting her enough time to gasp as I clutched her wet hair and yanked her back to my chest. She twisted her body into me and lifted her knee to drive it up into my gut. I took the repeated hit two more times before I laughed and reached for the hem of her dress that had risen up her thighs.
Shoving it up her torso, she swatted at my hand as she tried to back away, but with her hair wrapped in my fist, she wasn’t going anywhere. Growling, she grabbed at my arm holding her, using it for leverage to lift her entire body and shove her heel right under my jaw.
The kick was just enough for my grip to loosen, allowing her hair to slip through my fingers, the release causing her to drop to the floor. She recovered just as quickly as I did, back on her feet, adjusting her dress and grabbing at the first item she could reach.
“I still owe you some hell for that fucking sham of a charity gala!” she growled, throwing a small ceramic display bowl at my head. I dodged it easily, the bowl flying right over my shoulder and shattering against the wall as I charged for her.
Her eyes widened, and she bolted back, damn near leaping over the couch before I caught her around the waist mid-jump and hauled her back to me.
“Yes, you do,” I agreed, turning from the couch with her back tucked against my side. Jaden bucked and twisted until I positioned her to bend over the arm of the couch.
“What the hell was that? Why would you expose yourself like that and help fund your own opposition?” she hissed as she tried to push away from where I had her pinned under me.

Gripping the hem of her dress again, I pulled the wet material up until the perfect curves of her ass fell right into my hands, a lacy black thong peeking between her cheeks. Despite the small round scar that lingered on one cheek, Jaden’s ass was still something to marvel at. So much so, I’d almost forgotten she’d spoken.
“I can hardly call them my opposition when they’re so good at unwittingly eliminating all of my competitors,” I answered, squeezing those perfectly round globes. “My donations fund their operations to unknowingly track down my competition. Multiple groups reveal all the new secrets and methods being used to find them.” I pressed myself into her, letting her feel my hardened cock between her cheeks. “The latest tech and software, the most recent targets and raids, the preventive measures, all the connections to the deepest insights, police, judges, private investigators
—it keeps me well informed and ahead of the game.”
Jaden pushed back against me, her frustration grating her voice. “That’s disgusting,” she barked, then jammed her sharp little elbow into my rib cage repeatedly until I grabbed her hair and shoved her face down into the cushions.
“Why? Because it puts me at an advantage?”
She turned her head to the side and snarled. “No. Because it makes you the one thing you told me you never were. A liar!”
With her feet dangling above the floor, Jaden was somehow able to pull her knees up and kicked her heels into my thighs, digging in hard enough for her to gain the leverage she needed.
With one foot still planted firmly against my leg, she used it to lift her body up and kicked me in the sternum with everything she had. The impact was hard enough to push me away, giving her the chance to flip herself over and somersault to the other side of the couch.
“A liar, huh?” I pressed, cocking a brow.

“Pretending to be something you’re not? Deliberately misleading those people for your own gain? Yeah, I’d call that a lie,” she snarled.
My muffled laughter filled the air. “Funny, I don’t recall ever being asked by any of them if I specifically engage in such a trade. Seems like an odd question to ask someone at a charity event.”
She growled, her beautiful face twisting into a cute little scowl. “A wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a lie!” she shouted.
I almost snorted at the ridiculous idiom.
“Keeping my business to myself is not a violation of my own code of ethics,” I said, moving around the couch to herd her away from it. “I am not beholden to your standards, my little wife. You are beholden to mine.”
Grabbing the frame, I shoved the couch to the side and out of my way, the action causing Jaden to kick at the coffee table between us, flipping it up to crash against my shins.
I barreled through it, kicking it out of my way with my harsh steps, my eyes tracking Jaden’s every move as she reached for a nearby glass figurine and launched it at me. I could have dodged it, but I decided to catch it instead. I didn’t want more glass covering the floor while she was still barefoot.
“No more glass,” I warned, dropping it on the chaise lounge. “I don’t want you cutting up your feet.” Jaden paused for a moment, arching a brow at me before releasing a short, sharp laugh. I shook my head as I lunged for her.
She instantly dropped to the floor, rolling into a tight somersault right under my arms, then rising back on her feet far behind me. Her hand instantly snaked out to snatch another goddamn figurine and lifted it over her head.
What the fuck…
I was going to kill whoever the fuck decorated this house with so much breakable shit.

“Don’t you fucking dare!” I roared. “What did I just say!” My patience for her disobedience was running thin. If she cut her feet, so help me God… Jaden paused to lower the object and quickly knocked on it with her knuckles, glancing down as she did and then back up at me. “It’s plastic,”
she assured, then chucked it across the room at me.
My chest rumbled with agitation as I barely twisted my torso to allow the “plastic” figurine to fly past me as I charged for her. She made it only a few steps before I tackled her to the nearby rug, tumbling so that she fell on top of me to cushion her blow to the floor.
Flipping us over, I pressed myself between her legs, taking the hem of her dress between my hands and ripping it up the side seam. “You’re such a little brat,” I snarled as I smacked the side of her bare ass hard enough to echo through the room.
Jaden yelped as she wrestled with my hands, trying to pry herself away from me. When that didn’t work, she pulled her knees in and shoved them inward against my chest, pushing me back so that she could try to kick off into a backward somersault. But her move failed when I grabbed her ankle and pulled her lower body back down.
She took the opportunity to wrap her leg around the back of my neck and then hooked the knee of her other leg around her shin, trapping my neck and arm between her legs. Securing my stretched-out arm with her own, she squeezed her thighs tightly to lock in an impressive triangle choke, compromising my air supply and blood flow.
I groaned with a grin under the strain, glad to see she had regained the strength in her legs. But when she caught the smile on my face, she growled and squeezed even harder.
Goddamn, she’s fucking strong.
I considered just lifting her and slamming her back down to the floor, but I didn’t want to hurt her that much right now.

So instead, I went for one of her own usual annoying but sometimes effective moves. I reached out with my fingertips and pinched the sensitive skin right between the curves of her ass cheeks.
She gasped in shock, the sharp pain causing her grip around my neck to loosen just enough for me to break out of her hold and lunge forward to trap her legs under me. Pressing down, I pinned her pelvis in place with my own, returning to my earlier task of ripping her wet clothes off.
“Nice try,” I commemorated, the stitching coming apart like paper. “That’s my move,” she grunted as she managed to land two more
punches to the side of my face as I yanked the ruined fabric off her.
Her third punch found itself trapped in my palm before it could land. Wrapping my hand around her wrist, I forced it to the floor, squeezing hard enough to make her wince.
It would be so easy for me to break her wrist again with just a few more pounds of pressure, but I didn’t want her incapacitated from another bone fracture. I’d prefer her incapacitation be from something far more rewarding for us both. Or at least, one of us.
“Not a fan when it’s reversed, huh?”
“It’s beneath you,” she retorted as she dug her heels into the floor, pointlessly attempting to pull at my fingers that remained locked around her other wrist.
Some days I wasn’t sure if it was compassionate or cruel to allow her the use of one of her arms while I restrained the other. Compassion in the freedom from restraint or cruelty in crushing the hope of a worthless advantage.
Laughter hummed in the back of my throat at the thought. “The only thing that’s beneath me right now is you.”
Ripping away the final remnants of her clothes, I tore at her strapless bra, flinging it across the room. Grabbing her other flailing wrist, I pinned both on either side of her head and buried my face between her damp

breasts. Her cold, wet skin met the new stubble on my jaw, the friction causing her to shiver as she fought against my grip.
The familiar tug of her desperate attempts to break my hold brought a savage smile to my face. I missed this. I missed this fight in her. And I missed fucking it right out of her system.
I moaned with satisfaction as I held her down. “I missed this struggle with you,” I murmured, running my nose along the side of her cheek. “Do you remember how it was in the beginning? When I held you down like this, and you fought against every modicum of pleasure I gave you?”
Jaden scoffed, twisting her head to the side. “You mean when you first started raping me?” she snapped. “Yeah, I remember it vividly.”
I chuckled softly as I drew one of her peaked nipples into my mouth, sucking hard until she squirmed under me even more. She drew in a sharp gasp as her back arched, pushing more of herself into my mouth for the taking. Fuck, my cock was turning into a steel rod in my pants, ready to bury itself home.
“Do you also remember how fucking wet you were?” I teased, dragging the flat of my tongue across the swollen nub. I loved reminding her often of how her body easily surrendered to its impulses while her mind and heart continued to rebel at their own peril. “You were soaking then, just like I know you’re soaking now.”
Jaden groaned as she tried twisting her body under me but quickly discovered how useless that was. “You’re such a fucking asshole!”
Pulling back, I placed both of her wrists in one hand, then slapped her across the face. Not as hard as she deserved, but hard enough to grab her attention.
“I’ve just about had it with that disrespectful mouth of yours,” I growled. “And I’ve let you get away with it for long enough.”
Grabbing the flimsy wet fabric of her thong, I ripped it from her hips, the lining snapping sharply against her skin and causing her to cry out. I

then balled it up in my hand and shoved it into her mouth, sealing my palm over her lips. Jaden shrieked in protest, twisting her head back and forth, attempting to dislodge my grip.
“Cuss again, and I swear to God, this won’t be the only thing you choke on tonight,” I warned, my patience for her inability to follow simple rules running out. Granted, I did enable her far too often. Jaden inhaled deeply through her nose when I pressed the rough wet fabric of my pants against her clit. “Do you understand?”
She grunted in the affirmative, her eyes wincing shut as she tried to nod her head.
“Good girl.”
Removing my hand, Jaden immediately twisted her head to the side and spit her ruined thong out onto the floor.
“And here I thought you’d finally given up,” she snapped bitterly.
I tsk’d at her comment. “You should know better than that by now,” I replied, and then sunk my teeth into her shoulder, biting down hard enough to elicit a cry from her lips. My tongue grazed along her neck as I sucked her skin into my mouth, intent on adding some fresh art to the fading masterpiece around her throat.
It wasn’t ten seconds later that Jaden’s fight began to slow, her energy draining far too quickly for my taste. That was why I liked the chase beforehand. The adrenaline rushing through her veins intensified her fight, prolonging the game and making the victory that much sweeter.
“Oh, come on,” I taunted, pressing my rock-hard length against her pelvis, unreasonably torturing myself. “I know you’re better than this.”
It didn’t take much to piss her off, the insult rupturing the dam containing her civility. Snapping to her left, she managed to reach out and clamp her teeth onto my forearm, biting deep into the skin.
“Fuuuccckkkk,” I practically moaned with joy, the pain of Jaden’s bite surging straight to my dick.

Pulling back, I yanked her up by her wrists, dislodging her teeth from my arm to reveal a bloodstained grin on her beautifully flushed face. Leaning down, I took her mouth hard, my lips claiming hers while my tongue delved into her mouth, tasting my own blood.
Jaden tried to pull away, but I locked both of her wrists behind her lower back, my arms keeping her firmly in place. I kissed her violently, taking and conquering all that I could and still demanding more.
When I finally released her mouth, I gripped her throat and shoved her back down to the floor, keeping her pinned while I examined the bite mark she’d given me.
Her teeth had sunk right into my eagle tattoo, the little indents circling the head of it like she had been trying to bite its head off. With my blood ringing its neck, it looked like she had succeeded. Fuck, I hope it scarred.
“Your little love bites are so endearing,” I mused, studying the pattern of her teeth.
“I’m happy to give you another one,” she replied, wrapping her arm around mine in an attempt to dislodge it from her neck.
Releasing her, I traded it for both of her wrists in one hand and forced them above her head. Leaning down, I ran my nose along the bridge of hers, enjoying the flex of her muscles every time she tried to twist out of my grip. It just made me smile like the savage that I was.
“Fuck,” I groaned as I pushed into her hips, my cock painfully hard. “I may need you to start fighting me again like you did in the beginning, back when you still had hope.”
That made her pause, her gaze locking with mine. A hazy liquid amber swirled in her pretty eyes, mixing with flecks of green and traces of brown. Like the final days of autumn still clutching to life before winter buried it beneath its icy chill. But all those beautiful colors couldn’t conceal the raging violence brewing behind them.

“You are such a sick fuck.” She emphasized the curse on purpose, then slammed her forehead into my nose, just like the fire-breathing goddess she was.
I reared back, my nose taking all of her brunt force and causing pain to shoot up through my forehead, though not enough to break it. I chuckled as I released her arms and then flipped her onto her stomach.
“Yeah, but I’m your sick fuck,” I rasped, and replaced myself between her legs.
Jaden tried to get up with the advantage of the new position, but my hand snaking out to wrap around her now damp hair had her rethinking her plans. Slamming her head down, I dug her cheek into the rug, eliciting a hiss from her throat as she tried to push back.
Yanking at my belt, I undid my stiff wet pants and pulled out my throbbing cock, desperate for something warm, wet, and mine. Shifting Jaden’s hips up, I entered her pussy without any warning, the impact forcing a sharp cry from her lips.
I didn’t give her the chance to adjust, locking her wrists behind her back and fucking her into a delirious frenzy. Her pussy clenched around me, squeezing my cock like a vise, and it just made me fuck her harder.
“Tell me you’re mine,” I ordered, yanking her by her hair as I pounded her into the floor. She whined beautifully, fighting back hard on those high- pitched cries I loved forcing her to make. “Now,” I snarled, sharply smacking the side of her ass.
“Oh God, I’m yours, you fucking asshole!” she screeched as her pussy spasmed around me.
Reaching out for her discarded thong, Jaden beat me to it, swiping it away and out of reach.
“Oh, you little brat,” I sneered, slamming my palm down onto her ass harder this time and making her jolt. “That’s fine. You can choke on this instead.”

Keeping her wrists in one hand, I reached the other around her face and shoved my fingers into her mouth. The rest of my hand clung around her jaw, keeping it open as I fucked her even harder.
She cried out, fighting my hold on her face as my fingers tortured her gag reflex, but I didn’t give her an inch, forcing her head up as I kept up my pace. The grunts and groans from her mouth sported a new tune as her vocal cords competed against the intrusion.
Feeling her warm, wet tongue around my fingers with her warm, wet pussy around my cock was an interesting combination. Apparently, her body thought so too as her walls suddenly clamped down on my cock, her entire body rupturing around me as she came undone.
I sneered as I released her mouth and allowed her to ride out the rest of her orgasm before I withdrew entirely. Using the head of my cock, I rubbed that intoxicating liquid heat of hers all the way up to that second incredibly fuckable hole she had.
“Wait, wait,” Jaden panted as she fought to catch her breath, but I just shook my head.
“No.”
Jaden tensed as I began to push inside her ass, the tight ring of muscle fighting against my entry. I’d fucked Jaden’s ass plenty of other times since our wedding, yet she still hadn’t managed to learn how to relax properly. One of these days, she’d figure it out, but until then, I didn’t mind coaching her through it.
“Breathe, princess,” I reminded her, gently spreading her cheeks. “You know how this works.” A low whimper left her throat as she worked to relax her muscles, allowing me to slide in farther. “Good girl.”
Rewarding her, I rubbed the pads of my still wet fingers along the seam of her pussy, causing her body to shudder as she moaned into the carpet. Flipping my hand over, I inserted two fingers inside her, extending my thumb to flick across her swollen clit.

More soft moans rang out as I began to fuck her pussy with my fingers, allowing my cock to slide all the way into her ass.
“Goddamn,” I groaned, her tightness choking my cock to the point of pain.
Pulling out, I pushed back in, stretching her wide to accommodate my size. Finding a rhythm, I fucked her ass while my fingers were buried deep inside her, my thumb catching her clit with every stroke.
“Oooooh God!” she whined, her voice strained from so much stimulation it was a wonder she could even form words.
Yanking her back by her hair, I leaned down into her ear. “I’m right here, princess.”
A sharp cry echoed throughout the room. “I can’t—I can’t—” she begged, breathless, and barely able to finish her plea. “Please stop. It’s too much. I can’t! Ah!”
A soft chuckle rumbled in my throat. “I love hearing you beg.”
I instantly increased my pace, driving in and out of her without the mercy she knew didn’t exist. Mercy was not a term I entertained or honored.
“But I’m not giving you a damn choice,” I growled and shoved her head back down into the rug. Like an absolute animal, I finished her off like I was at war, savagely taking every centimeter of her until her screams could no longer be contained.
The music she made as I brought her to the most intense climax she’d ever had was the final catalyst I needed to push me over the edge and detonate inside her. I could feel my cum coating her walls, the pleasure washing through me in waves as I emptied myself completely.
When I was finally sated, I pulled out, my cum instantly leaking out all over her pussy and ass.
Fucking beautiful.

But the second I released her hips from my bruising grip, Jaden collapsed to the floor in a heap, her eyes closed as she focused on regulating her erratic breathing.
I stood and pulled off the rest of my wet pants, my gaze focused on the steady rising and falling of Jaden’s chest. Standing over her, I admired all that she was—capable of taking on so much damage in a single instance, just to shed it all off after a couple of days of rest.
Her resilience was incredible, but it had to be exhausting, especially when I kept throwing bricks at her. But rather than avoiding them like most might, she chose to collect them instead and then built herself a fucking fortress around her mind strong enough to withstand anything, including me.
When we got home, I’d make sure she wouldn’t be building walls to keep me out anymore. The only thing she’d be building for the next nine months was my fucking child.
“Come on, my little queen,” I said with a grunt, bending down to throw her dead weight over my shoulder. “Time for that shower.”





39.

CATACLYSM.









The following morning, I woke to a strange sense of dread. I felt heavy, weighted down by more than just the strain in my muscles from all the
“brat taming” Darren did yesterday.
Either my tolerance for his ruthlessness was increasing or my body had finally figured out how to run on nothing but spite. But none of it compared to the mountain of anticipation that pulsed in my chest at the realization of just one more day.
What the hell would my tomorrow look like after it was over? What bed would I wake up in then? Or was this all just another pipe dream?
Fuck, what if the whole operation failed? What if Darren survives and it only makes things worse? Matt didn’t give me shit to work with, and now, I was living on pins and needles of what-ifs and hows.
What if Jason really did join the fight tomorrow, and Darren killed him? My heart broke at the very thought. It was an incredibly high possibility, and I knew the opportunity would be all too pleasurable for Darren.
He’d probably strive to take him alive just to slowly torture him to death while I watched. I could not let that happen. When the time came, I would have to make sure the fight was successful.

After washing up and readying for what could be my last day of this life, I took Camaro down to the dining room for a late breakfast. I noticed an unusual amount of guards posted throughout the house, heightening my nerves even more for tomorrow’s impending battle.
Darren was nowhere to be seen, making me wonder what his agenda would be for the day. So I just asked my question aloud hoping one of the dozen guards nearby would hear and answer.
“Anyone know where the boss is?” I asked sardonically.
The room was silent for several awkward seconds until someone finally spoke up.
“He’s out riding this morning, Mrs. Davis,” one of the guards replied.
I nodded my acknowledgment, fixing myself a plate of waffles and fruit while Camaro went for her dog bowl nearby. At least I’d have some time alone to calm my nerves before Darren came back.
I picked at my breakfast quietly, finding my appetite to be a continued struggle. I couldn’t eat when my nerves were this shot. But I had to keep up appearances and force myself to eat. I would need my strength for whatever tomorrow brought.
Barely finishing my plate, I stood from my seat, ready to go see Luna, the horse Darren had gifted me as a wedding present. But just as I was about to head for the door, I was immediately halted, the guard standing at the door raising his hand.
“Sorry, Mrs. Davis, but you’re to remain inside today unless accompanied by Mr. Davis. No exceptions.”
My eyes went wide with rage. “Are you fucking kidding me?”
“No, ma’am,” he answered, shaking his head with what almost seemed like sympathy.
“Why?”
“It’s not my place to question him.”

I rolled my eyes at the useless response. “Well, when is he coming back?”
“I’m not sure,” he answered. “How long ago did he leave?” “About thirty minutes ago.”
I groaned and spun away in frustration.
Fuck.
He would probably be gone for another hour or two. That motherfucker. Fresh with rage, I stormed down the hallway with Camaro attempting to keep up behind me. Rounding the corner, I headed for the gym to relieve my anger with a punching bag when the sound of a helicopter flying nearby
caught my attention.
If Darren was out riding, why was there a helicopter? Was he expecting someone?
The answer to my question came when the hallway ahead of me suddenly exploded. A storm of fire and heat and debris erupted in front of me, the mass of which was enough to send me flying backward, landing hard on my back and side.
Pain burst throughout my shoulder and hips, radiating straight to my pelvis. The heat of the fire licked at my skin, competing for attention as my ears rang from the roar of the blast. I could barely hear the rest of the security alarms going off, the muffled sound blaring in and out all around the house.
My vision wasn’t much better as I tried to fight through the disorientation, the room tilting on its side as water from the sprinkler system began raining down, soaking everything as it tackled the fire.
Somewhere beyond the noise, I could hear Camaro barking, but I couldn’t get my body to fucking cooperate. I struggled to pull myself up, the water soaking my clothes and making me feel even heavier than my rocked limbs already did.

“Camaro!” I screamed through the noise, trying to see past the water, smoke, and debris to find her. Despite multiple voices shouting and alarms blaring, I could hear her barking, her sharp whine leading me as I stumbled through the mess.
When the sprinkler system stopped, my eyes could focus, clarity finally returning to my rocked system. As I climbed over the debris, the sound of more men yelling had me rushing through until I finally found my poor dog stuck under some of the rubble of the house.
Lifting the heavy, wet boards up, Camaro scrambled to her feet, her body moving naturally without any painful cries. Relief filled me when I realized she wasn’t injured but quickly sank to dread when the sound of gunfire caught my ears.
Shit, was this the attack? They were a fucking day early!
“Mrs. Davis!” More shouts came from behind me. “Get down!” A group of guards had made their way into the hallway just when another group of gunmen entered from the destroyed blast site.
“Shit!” I yelled, ducking down behind more debris with Camaro just as the gunfire went off.
What the fuck had happened? Had Matt lied to me? I knew I was a goddamn fool for trusting him.
Cursing Matt for denying the very important details, I waited for the gunfire to cease before grabbing Camaro by the collar and rushing into the next room. After I practically threw ourselves into the space, I realized we had made it into the parlor. As the guards fought off the approaching gunmen, I raced to one of the cabinets and threw it open, grabbing one of Camaro’s protective body covers.
“Come here, girl,” I called, placing the body armor over her wet and dirt-covered torso, quickly strapping it on and tightening it as fast as I could. She growled as her paws clicked madly over the wood floors, her body turning toward the door to guard me.

With Camaro secure, I grabbed the armor fitted for me and strapped it over my wet clothes. Darren had once shown me where at least ten of these armor kits were hidden around the house.
He had little fail-safes scattered throughout every piece of property he owned for this very reason, but the ones I knew about where meant only for me, which meant they didn’t include any fucking guns, only knives, tasers, and first-aid kits.
As I tightened the straps, I remembered that Matt had warned me to be away from the house before the fight started. Clearly, whoever was here wasn’t too keen on ensuring I didn’t get caught in the crossfire. They’d blown up the side of the house I’d been walking through and shot in every direction without hesitation.
Did Matt tell them I wouldn’t be here?? That wouldn’t make sense if they were attacking early! Something was off about this attack. An objective to refrain from shooting at a very obvious redheaded woman with a dog should be an easy order to follow, but these guys weren’t even looking. What the fuck kind of rescue operation was this?
What if this isn’t your rescue mission at all?
My throat went dry at the very real possibility of that. Darren had many enemies. But what were the chances of back-to-back attacks from different adversaries?
The more I thought about it, the less sense any of this made. Dread seeped into my stomach as I considered the probability that Jason might not actually be in this fight. That I was about to engage in the wrong attack and completely blow my redemption period with Darren. If he caught me doing this and we both lived, I was going to be so fucked.
But there was only one way to know any of this for sure, and that meant shoving his latest rule right out the fucking window.
Like you were going to follow it anyway.
“Camaro,” I called, patting the side of my thigh for her to follow.

With knives in both hands, I slowly made my way around the doorway into the quiet hallway. I could see a few bodies crumpled over the debris of the house. Otherwise, no one else was around.
Hopefully, their guns were still attached. But then the sound of more heavy boots came barreling around the corner, fifty feet in front of me.
Only one way to find out if they’re here for me.
Hating this strategy, I stood just outside the doorway and waited for them to notice me. When they did, they all paused in unison, and I held my breath.
“Uh…hi?” I waved awkwardly.
Hi? That’s what you say?
I would have punched my inner monologue self, but I didn’t have the time. Devastation was just as swift as the bullets that were suddenly shot my way by the gunmen, forcing me to duck down and back into the room.
FUCK!
Rolling to the floor, I ducked down behind one of the couches as Camaro followed, moving just as quickly as the approaching footsteps. Hiding against the side of the tall liquor cabinet, I waited silently as the gunmen spread out into the room.
Thank fuck for all the noise and gunfire still going on around us, otherwise they probably would have heard Camaro’s panting next to me.
When the gunmen gathered into the right formation, I clutched my blades against my palms and made my move.
Sprinting into a run, I launched myself at the closest one before they noticed me, eliminating the distance he would need to shoot me. Both knives sank deep on either side of his neck as my legs wrapped around his waist, my front to his back.
The distraction gave Camaro the advantage of a sneak attack as she launched herself onto the closest gunman and trapped his jugular between her jaws.

Both men screamed. The momentum of my impact swung him around, effectively shielding me from the other gunmen lucky enough not to have something sharp buried in his neck. Yet.
Releasing my grip on one knife, I reached down and grabbed the pistol from his thigh holster and aimed it at the other gunmen, putting two bullets into his face. He dropped to the floor as I released the second knife still buried in the other one’s neck, then jumped down to kick him in the back of his knee. When he went down, I grabbed both of my knives and yanked them out, leaving him to choke on his own blood as he crumbled to the floor.
Walking around him, I moved for the last gunman, who was currently pressed up against the wall with a very large dog on top of him, wearing her jaw as a neck warmer. Watching him yank a knife from his belt, I lunged forward and stomped on his wrist, pinning it to the floor beneath my tennis shoe.
“Vabasta,” I ordered. Camaro immediately released her hold and stepped back, but her attention was still very much on the bleeding meat sack beneath her.
Crouching down, I placed my knife just under his eye, letting the tip softly drag along his skin.
“Is Jason with you?” I asked, keeping my voice low so that only he could hear.
While he was clearly in pain, he still managed to look confused. “Who…the fuck…is that?” he croaked out as he clutched at his mess of
a throat.
I tried not to be too disappointed with his answer. Not every foot soldier had all the information.
“Do you know who I am?”
More confusion. Not a good sign. “Why are you here?”

The gunman was not impressed with my twenty-one questions and just shook his head, a gurgled chuckle rolling up his throat. Pressing the knife deeper into his skin, I made sure the blade was a single millimeter away from puncturing through his lower eyelid.
“Why. Are. You. Here?” I tried again, maintaining the fake patience in my voice. If Darren caught me doing this, I’d be so goddamn fucked. Hopefully all the cameras in the area had been blown to shit too.
The gunman’s face twisted into an ugly scowl, so I added more of my weight onto his wrist, making him hiss as he sucked in a gargled breath.
“Payback,” he finally groaned. Didn’t sound like much of a rescue plan to me.
“Who sent you?” I asked, reducing the pressure. I needed to know if Matt had actually coordinated this attack and if Jason was involved.
He laughed again. “Get fucked, bitch,” he mumbled in Spanish.
With no emotion on my face, I pressed the knife into his eye, slowly increasing the pressure second by second until he started screaming.
“I’m going to slice your eyes open and then my dog is going to eat your fucking face if you don’t give me a name,” I seethed as blood leaked down his cheek. “Rainer? Spade? Miguel Spade?”
“Ah! Sí! Spade! Sí!” he shouted as his feet kicked against the floor.
I didn’t know whether to be disappointed or suspicious, but as I withdrew the knife and drove it into his skull, I decided it wasn’t enough to turn back.
Matt had emphasized enemies as friends, so it wouldn’t be entirely out of the question that Matt might have teamed up with Miguel and Jason to use their combined forces against Darren.
But if that were truly the case, their soldiers probably wouldn’t have shot at me just now.
I sighed with frustration as I listened to the sounds of the fighting throughout the house. There was noise everywhere, so pinpointing any one

sound was difficult.
The helicopter was still flying overhead, gunshots competing with the shouting voices of men as they fought while the house crumbled around us. It was a mess of chaotic racket with no discernible path for me to navigate through.
Loud gunfire cut through my thought process, the little sonic booms stealing all my focus. Until an even louder explosion suddenly overtook it, the sound of something metal and heavy crashing to the ground and scaring the absolute shit out of me.
Needing some kind of confirmation, I quickly peered through the bulletproof window in the hall to see what was now left of the helicopter as it burned in a heap of scrap over the grass. And then my gaze moved beyond it to catch Darren casually tossing what looked like a grenade launcher to the ground.
Well, wasn’t he just resourceful?
With the threat of the helicopter gone, I decided now was probably the right time to scope the place for more information before Darren caught up to me.
If Jason wasn’t in this particular fight, then there was no way in hell I was getting out of here. But I needed to look for him to be absolutely sure. I needed to know if he was here. And the only way to do that was to be seen by the men with guns. And I needed to somehow make that happen without ending up like the damn helicopter.
Collecting the guns and ammunition of the dead gunmen, I quickly armed myself to the max. Pressing the cheap AK-47 to my shoulder, I looked down my sight to the end of the hallway. Aside from all the debris and dead bodies littering every square foot, there was no one left in this area, though I could still hear gunfire in the distance.
Stupid idea. This was a fucking stupid idea.
What the hell else are you gonna do? Hide like Darren told you to?

No, I needed to see this through. I couldn’t afford to be a coward and waste the opportunity.
Creeping through the hallway with Camaro following closely at my side, I carefully stepped around the dead bodies scattered in every direction. Each one I came to brought a tsunami of dread as I feared I would stumble upon Jason’s dead body. I had to check every single one to rule out the possibility, then collected tokens of guns and ammunition after the relief set in. Now I just had to hope I had enough time before Darren found me. If he found me.
I continued maneuvering through the house until stray bullets shot through the walls ahead of me. Dropping low to the ground, I crouched quickly through the house, hoping to find a good vantage point somewhere. It sounded like it was coming from the the kitchen. Circling back, I made my way around the lobby and then stopped dead as two gunmen rounded the corner.
I pulled the trigger without thinking, spraying their legs with bullets until they both dropped to the floor. Racing over to them, I kicked their guns out of reach while Camaro jumped on top of one and growled in his face.
“Why are you here?” I asked, my rifles pointed at their face. They both moaned in agony.
“Fuck you, bitch,” the one said and moved to grab his pistol from his
leg.
But Camaro was already on him, chomping her teeth down onto his arm
and crushing his bones. He screamed as he wrestled with Camaro, dropping the gun to the floor as he tried to push her off him. I kicked the gun away, then whistled for Camaro to back off. The guy instantly clutched his arm, squirming in pain from both his busted legs and arms.
“Did Matthew Rainer send you?” I asked aloud.

And again, they looked confused. But I didn’t get much time to dwell on it as the sound of metal clinked near my foot. Looking down, my heart stopped when I realized it was a fucking grenade.
“Shit!” I shouted, kicking the grenade away and grabbing Camaro by the collar as we vaulted in the opposite direction. But the ensuing explosion was still too close and caused one of the nearby walls to collapse overtop of me. The pressure made it difficult to breathe as the weight of the wall instantly forced me to the ground, my legs and waist pinned under the heavy drywall and shelving.
“Fuck!” I cursed to myself as I tried to push the wall off me. I was a sitting fucking duck under this thing.
Camaro raced to my side, her snout going in all directions as she tried to sniff out the solution to my confinement. Her only option was to whine and bark out her distress.
“Quiet,” I told her, wincing to myself as I tried to wiggle free as much as I could. Grabbing a broken piece of shelf, I wrapped both hands around each end and held it out above my head. “Camaro, bite, pull,” I ordered. Sharp canine teeth bit down onto the wood and pulled the material, yanking left and right until one of my legs finally came loose. “Good girl!” I praised, pulling myself up for more leverage, but my other leg was still trapped. “Fuck,” I muttered as the pain began to build in my leg from the pressure.
More stomping boots in the background had me moving even faster until my eyes caught those boots in my gaze.
Shit.
Reaching down, I managed to pull the pistol from my side and fired two shots at the quickly approaching gunmen. The first one went down, but as I pulled the trigger for another shot, there was nothing but a clicking sound.
Fucking empty.

Fear hit me hard as the remaining four gunmen lifted their rifles and aimed right at my fearless dog just as she lunged for them.
“No!”





40.

SECURED.









The wind whipped through my hair as I rode down the path, Elsie galloping beneath me at a quick and even pace. When the first target appeared between the trees, I raised my Winchester lever-action rifle and fired, the bullet tearing through the little red dot in the center. Keeping focus, Elsie blazed down the path while my attention moved to each
appearing target, a single bullet penetrating the bull’s-eye each time.
Runs like these allowed me to clear my head, my body operating on autopilot and muscle memory as I cleared my moving targets one by one. With everything that had happened in the past forty-eight hours, I needed a few moments of clarity, away from the demands of constant chaos.
For the first time in a long time, I did not have all the answers. And it was making me incredibly irritable and murderous.

Still one step ahead of you.

The words taunted me, something most of my enemies did not do. They couldn’t afford that kind of game. They had to be more discreet in their attempts  to  thwart  me,  keeping  silence  to  maintain  their  safety  in

anonymity. But their identities didn’t remain secret for long, my retribution steadfast and absolute.
But this new adversary was different. They were deliberately trying to provoke me, taking their sweet-ass time with whatever the fuck it was they were trying to accomplish. But the attacks didn’t make sense.
First, they killed the man responsible for attacking us in Rome, then they killed my surveillance team tasked with hunting down Matt. The motives weren’t connecting.
And to top it all off, Jaden and the auction were both attacked on the same night. Had the whole thing just been some elaborate distraction to steal nearly two million dollars from our accounts while no one was looking?
Shifting my aim for the final time, I pulled the trigger, eliminating my last target of the run. I sighed as I pulled on Elsie’s reins, signaling her to slow down.
I just needed to remain patient. One way or another, my enemies always revealed themselves, whether they wanted to or not. And when this one did, they’ll wish they had never even heard of my fucking name.
Elsie trotted into a stop, snorting soundly just as Scott pulled up beside me on Zac, finishing his run of the targets. His energy was wrought with agitation as he pocketed his rifle in the saddle holster, his brow knitted together.
“The point of this exercise is to recalibrate, not antagonize ourselves,” I commented as I slid my rifle into my holster.
Scott shook his head, his eyes still brimming with frustration. “I can’t shake this feeling that we’re missing something bigger. Something right under our nose. It’s driving me nuts,” he muttered, his voice strained with contempt. I nodded in agreement.
Turning our horses around, we slowly made our way down the wide, open path back to the estate.

“Once we’ve exterminated Miguel, we can refocus our efforts,” I said, cracking a kink in my neck. “If we stretch our resources too thin, then they’ll become useless, and you know how I feel about useless things.”
Scott dipped his chin. “Miguel has to be nearly bled dry by now. All those safe-houses were demolished within hours of each other. He has no resources left on this side of the border.”
“That we know of,” I added grimly.
We were silent as we continued down the path, lost in our thoughts and theories of what was to come. Scott was right, though. We were missing something, and in my line of work, missing something was a deadly mistake to make.
I fully planned to personally double my efforts into hunting this shadow clown before he, or she, became emboldened to attempt more damage.
“The wind is picking up,” Scott suddenly commented as a heavy breeze blew through the trees.
I nodded as I reached back for my phone when the light sound of an approaching helicopter caught my attention.
“Are we expecting anyone I don’t know about?” I asked Scott. “No,” he answered sharply.
Kicking Elsie into gear, Scott and I raced back down the path just as a loud explosion rocked the air, throwing both our horses into a fit.
Fuck!
Elsie and Zac both suddenly skidded to a stop, bucking and kicking, a shrill squeal echoing through the trees. Tightening my legs, I pulled the reins to keep myself from falling off as I tried to rope Elsie back under control.
When her front hooves finally touched the ground, I kicked hard, driving her to race off toward the noise. Scott was only a few paces behind me after regaining control of Zac, pushing just as hard as me to get back to the estate.

Two days. Two fucking days and now my private home was being attacked, with the most precious item I owned not permitted to leave it.
God-fucking-dammit.
When the sound of gunfire erupted, I kicked even harder. We were nearly ten minutes out on a steady cantor, but I aimed to cut that time in half, fueled by the wrath simmering in my blood.
Keeping steady, I managed to pull out my phone to check Jaden’s vitals, ensuring she was still alive. Her heart rate was through the roof, but she was alive. For now.
Whoever the fuck thought to enter my property today, I would end their entire fucking bloodline before the sun went down.
Finally breaching the trees, I could see a black gunship helicopter hovering next to the house, smoke filtering from the destruction as it began to rain gunfire across the lawns.
Launching myself from Elsie, I quickly descended into the dog kennel, ignoring the chaotic barking and howling as I pressed the hidden trigger release on the wall to reveal an extensive arsenal of weapons.
Grabbing the RPG, I heaved it over my shoulder, engaged the settings, then marched out onto my lawn. Taking aim, I fired it at the damn chopper, the explosion a satisfying storm of thunder as it erupted into a fiery ball of crushed metal, crashing to the ground with a loud metallic thud.
Tossing the RPG aside, Scott and I turned back to the kennel to quickly arm ourselves and made our way to the house. Checking my phone for Jaden’s location, imagine my fucking surprise when I saw she was not yet bunkered down in one of the panic rooms where she was supposed to be by now.
Both of her legs had better be fucking broken or I was going to break them myself and permanently chain her to our bed when this was over.
“You take the east. I’ll take the west,” I said to Scott as we approached the back of the house. “Jaden is the top priority.”

“On it,” he replied before separating from me to head in the opposite direction.
Creeping through my own house, I quickly maneuvered around the disheveled furniture and chunks of blown-apart drywall, following the sound of gunfire and combat.
Sliding to my knees, I knelt beside an upturned table just as a swarm of bullets burst overhead. Shoulder to the floor, I returned fire, my aim far better than that of my adversaries. Moving past their dead bodies, I pressed my rifle hard against my shoulder and squeezed off two more rounds, dropping two more unsuspecting bodies to the floor.
The sound of barking among the gunfire caught my ears.
“Camaro!” I called as I moved toward the sound of her bark. Jaden’s mark had placed her somewhere near the parlor, so she had to be close.
But before I could advance, the muzzles of several rifles rounded the corner. Lifting my knee, I kicked the rifles hard, throwing off the trajectory, and slammed the butt of my M16 into the face of the nearest body.
Bringing the rifle back up, I fired it at the second gunman in the throat, then grabbed the top of the third gunman’s rifle, bullets firing from the barrel as I steered it around to fire at the first of them. Dropping my gun, I ripped my knife from my belt and shoved it into his trachea, yanking it out to cut more of his arteries than was necessary.
A body then slammed into me from behind, my momentum following the flow of energy to twist around and out of his hold. He lifted his leg to kick me, my body turning to the side to trap his leg between my arm and ribs before my elbow slammed down on top of his kneecap, breaking it in place.
Satisfied with his howling, a quick glimpse of his utility vest showed two grenades attached, prompting me to reach out and snatch the pin from one of them. I then kicked him into the next room, right into two more of his buddies, all three bodies crashing to the floor.

Picking my rifle back up, I bolted from the area just as the grenade went off, the sharp explosion activating the designated area sprinkler system and the familiar ringing in my ear. Increasing my pace, I leaped over debris as I followed the sound of Camaro’s bark until I heard it morph into a vicious series of snarls.
Fuck!
I abruptly halted in my tracks when I came upon several more gunmen, the barrels of their rifles moving low toward the ground. Two gunshots were fired, dropping one of the gunmen to the ground while the rest advanced.
“No!” Jaden’s panicked voice screamed just as Camaro came into my vision.
Firing off multiple shots, I sprayed my bullets into the backs of two men before they crumpled to the ground. I groaned as I realized my clip was now fucking empty, and I lacked the time to reload.
Advancing quickly on the others who had now scattered, I slammed the butt of my gun into the temple of the nearest one while kicking the rifle out of the hands of the one at my right.
Retrieving my hunting knife from my side, I ducked below a swinging fist and drove the serrated blade into their side, twisting it deep before yanking it back out. Blood sprayed across my face, the smell antagonizing that demon inside me, the one that lusted for carnage.
Quickly lifting my arm, I blocked the aim of the pistol directed at me just as it fired into the ground. Kicking in his knee, the gunman screamed as his body dropped low, giving me the opportunity to shove my knife deep into his throat.
Dodging another strike coming from my left, I grabbed the raised arm, twisted my body and hurled the fucker over my shoulder and into the torso of the last approaching gunman. Both men went down, their backs hitting

the floor hard just as I drew my Berretta and fired a shot into each of their throats.
Moving between their mangled bodies, Camaro barked one hell of a snarl as she stood over Jaden, her teeth bared in warning. Rage ripped through me like lightning when I noticed she was wearing one of her protective vests that were also stored alongside Jaden’s. If she had time to armor her dog, then she had time to get her ass to one of the many panic rooms hidden throughout the house.
“Discedant,” I ordered, Camaro relaxing her stance and immediately backing out of the way.
Pocketing my pistol at my lower back, I crouched down to find Jaden staring blankly up at me, her amber eyes wet with fear as her hands clutched the wall she was clearly trapped under. Pressing my hands under the debris, I heaved it up, shoving it away with a crashing thud, dust swarming into the air.
Jaden tried to pull herself up, but I beat her to it by grabbing the shoulder strap of her protective vest and yanking her to me. She practically dangled on her toes as I took stock of her appearance, noticing all the magazines of different calibers strapped to her vest, accompanied by three knives, two Glocks, and a single grenade. She was also soaking wet, donning bits of dust and drywall in her damp hair while her skin was marred with even more scratches and bruises than before.
An ungodly amount of fury rushed through me at Jaden’s blatant disregard for my orders, clearly choosing to engage rather than run like I had literally just told her to merely two days ago.
When my eyes locked with hers, her chest shuddered as her glossy gaze filled with dread. I wanted to instantly strangle her all over again. And she knew it.
“You’ve disobeyed me for the last time,” I growled.

Hauling her in the direction of the nearest panic room, I whistled for Camaro to follow as more gunfire echoed in the background. My urgency to get Jaden under ground intensified as it drew closer.
“Darren, wait!” she pleaded as she tried to regain her footing while I practically dragged her across the floor. “I was trying to find one! But the house was blown to shit! There were gunmen everywhere! I wasn’t going to look for a panic room unarmed!”
My blood boiled hotter and hotter with every lie she spoke in her defense, unwilling to entertain a single word from her until I had her safely bunkered down.
The fact that I couldn’t kill Clive and Owen a second time with my own hands pissed me off even more. If they had handled the attack in Chicago better, they would still be alive to be here to protect Jaden from her own stupidity.
Fuckers were lucky they were already dead.
Movement at the far end of the hall caught my attention. Gripping Jaden’s vest, I shoved her through the nearest open doorway as I trained my pistol in the direction of the gunfire aimed at us. I gritted my teeth as a bullet grazed my arm before two of my own entered the skulls of the gunmen ahead of us, dropping them both to the ground.
Turning back into the room, I found Jaden trying to pick herself up from the floor, grumbling under her breath. Yanking her back up to stand, I didn’t wait for her to regain her balance as I continued to drag her down the hallway.
“Darren, wait!” she continued to protest as she uselessly pulled against my grip.
Ignoring her pleas, I practically threw her against the wall of what was left of the library. I reached down to remove the rug, concealing the hidden lever of the trapdoor underneath. Lifting the lid, I clocked my wife with a murderous glare and pointed at the descending stairway. “In. Now.”

“No, Darren, wait, wait! I don’t want to go down there! Please!” I cocked a brow at her sudden refusal.
Did she seriously just tell me no?
“I can’t be down there! I need to be outside! Please! I don’t want to be left in this house by myself! It’s on fire!” she screeched, panic rising in her voice as she started to back away.
My eyes narrowed at the oddly misplaced apprehension she was still wearing on her scraped-up face, and it made the well-controlled rage still simmering inside become absolutely volcanic.
I don’t have time for this shit.
In two steps, I marched forward and backhanded her so hard across the face she fell into the barely intact bookcase. Camaro whined as Jaden’s knees buckled, her motor skills dazed from the impact as she failed to regain her bearings.
With her diminished capacity, I easily threw her over my shoulder without a fight and moved back for the hidden stairs, whistling again for Camaro to go in ahead of us.
Her claws clicked along the metal stairs as I followed her in, closing the door over top of us and locking it in place. The bottom of the stairs yielded an open space wide enough to fit a twin bed, a fridge, a sink, and a tiny connected bathroom.
Jaden groaned and squirmed as I laid her down on the bed to disarm her body of every weapon she had collected from her kills. Each item I found brought me closer and closer to throttling her knowing she had engaged this many people. But I didn’t have time to punish her now. It would have to wait until this was over.
Despite her groaned protests, I gathered Jaden’s little stash and locked it all away in a large drawer. I then moved to retrieve my most reliable fail- safe, the only thing I could count on to keep Jaden obedient. When I turned

back around, she was clutching the side of her face as she pushed herself up against the wall.
“Darren, please don’t leave me down here,” she begged as I moved toward her. When her eyes landed on what was in my hand, more panic jolted her body. “Please! No! Take me outside! I don’t want to be trapped in here!”
Ignoring her nonsensical protest, I reached out and clutched her arm, hauling her to me as I removed the cap of the syringe with my teeth.
“No, Darren wait, wait!” she begged as she tried to maneuver away from me, pressing her hand against my wrist to stop me.
Camaro continued to whine loudly as I angrily whipped Jaden around onto her stomach, pressing my knee into her back to hold her down.
“Darren, no! Wait! Stop!” she cried as I pushed the needle into the back of her arm, injecting her with the sleeper agent calibrated just for her.
“Stop…” she mumbled before her eyes fell shut and her body finally went limp. Rolling her onto her back, I removed her vest and did a quick scan of her body, searching for obvious injuries. Relief was swift when all I found were scrapes, bruises, a few burns, and a shit ton of drywall dust.
Moving my gaze back to her face, I could see her reddened cheek was already starting to swell. She’d have one hell of a bruise and a massive headache when she woke up, but at least she’d be alive.
Rising to my feet, I grabbed a small ice pack from the freezer, wrapped it in medical gauze from a first-aid kit and placed it under her cheek. The swelling should be significantly reduced by the time I returned.
But the fact that I had to resort to such extreme measures was an infuriating mystery I’d have to dwell on at a later time. Right now, I needed to get back up there and handle whatever the fuck had decided to knock on my door.
And I needed to be able to do that without worrying about my disobedient brat of a wife. Knocking her ass out and hiding her in a safe

place was the only option I had since I couldn’t trust her to follow my orders. I’d enjoy rectifying that later.
“Stay, Camaro,” I told the dog, approving as she hopped up onto the bed and laid her head over Jaden’s torso with a sad whine. “Good girl.”
Turning to the monitors of the security cameras installed into the wall, I searched for my would-be enemy.
Two black vans idled before the front entrance, the chrome gate lying in pieces on the ground. Two of my men were lying dead or severely injured at their posts in front of the house. Six cameras from the east wing of the house were destroyed, but I spotted Scott moving through the halls, giving orders to my remaining guards.
With the two vans and the chopper, and what I could find on-screen, I estimated about twenty gunmen had descended into my home. And that was a deadly fucking mistake.
Pulling out several hidden drawers, I switched out my Kevlar plates with fresh ones and then slung an AK-12 over my shoulder. After strapping on two additional Glocks, two grenades, three knives, and several more magazines, I was sufficiently armed. I checked the cameras one last time to ensure no one was outside the trapdoor and quietly made my way back up the stairs.
Almost immediately, there was more gunfire in the background, and the sound drew my attention to the southern entrance. Maneuvering quickly through my destroyed house, the sounds of fighting increased as I got closer. Rounding the corner, I found Scott and two of my guards fighting off three more gunmen.
From my hidden vantage point, I was able to shoot a round into each of their legs. Shifting quickly, I slammed the butt of my rifle into the head of one while Scott and my guards did the same with the others. We would need some to survive for questioning later on. And I planned on having their night last for a very long time.

“You find her?” Scott asked as he knelt to hogtie their hands and feet. “She’s secure in bunker three. How many have you taken out?” “Including these three? Six.”
“There shouldn’t be very many left then. There are two vans parked outside.”
“I saw,” he confirmed with a nod.
“Try to keep as many alive as you can. I want at least five to gut later on.”
“I’ll do what I can, but I don’t think there are many left,” he replied with a bloody smirk on his face.
“I’ll head east and meet you at the front exit.”
“Have fun,” he jested before I turned away and headed farther into the house.
Rage filled the void in my chest at the state of my fucking house. It was completely destroyed, which meant Jaden couldn’t stay here any longer than completely necessary. Once I wrapped things up here, I’d have to move her to a nearby safehouse.
I managed to tag three more remaining gunmen, killing only one and clipping the limbs of the others with enough bullets to keep them from lifting a single toe. My guards had killed the rest that had scattered out along the rest of the property.
With the grounds finally secured, I ordered my men to clean up the bodies and to start working on damage control. With my medic team on their way, the only thing left to do was to drag some answers out of some soon-to-be very sorry assholes.
The corners of my mouth lifted as I made my way back through the house. Scott was going to need some assistance in stringing a bunch of dead motherfuckers up.

AFTERMATH.



Ice-cold water was thrown into the face of the man hanging by his wrists from the chains built into the wall. His dark beard was caked in blood, the
red droplets dripping onto his cheap leather boots.
The striking cold rush of the water abruptly woke him from his fist- induced coma, causing him to cough and sputter.
Four of his buddies were also strung up throughout the concrete room, their bodies wrought with destruction and wear from the small battle that had ended barely an hour ago.
Instead of just setting the metal bucket down, Scott threw the damn thing right into his chest, the bucket bouncing off him and clattering to the floor.
“That was excessive,” I commented, side-eyeing Scott as he moved on to one of the other captives. With so many of them, a team effort was needed.
Grabbing one of the wrenches off the nearby tray, I made my way toward the shivering fuck and placed his thumb between the clamps of the wrench and gently squeezed.
“How did you know we were at this location?” I asked calmly.
This particular location was pretty well-known among my inner crowd, since most of them attended my wedding here. But how they knew we

would be here when I literally decided on it only two days ago had me questioning that inner circle. I needed to know if I had any rats among my ranks and confidants.
He took several deep breaths then, his chest rising up and down as he contemplated how many fingers he wanted to lose before I killed him. I gave him five seconds to decide before squeezing the clamps until they cut through the flesh of his thumb. A squeal of a scream escaped his lips, a pathetic sound I intended to amplify.
“Answer my question or I’ll finish what I started,” I said, squeezing the wrench just a little tighter.
He groaned as he sucked in another breath, his eyes moving back and forth from me to Scott as he began cutting off his screaming captive’s ear. It was nice having some extra motivation in the room.
“Okay, okay,” he began, his heavy breathing becoming increasingly annoying. “The information w-was given from an outside s-source. But I’m too low in the r-ranks to know who or c-care.”
His Mexican accent was thick as he spoke in stuttering English. I squeezed the wrench until the bone between it finally snapped, crunching under the pressure like a walnut.
“Fuck!” he screamed, the sound bouncing off the concrete walls and causing the other captives to jerk in their chains. I couldn’t help but snort.
“You’re going to have to do better than that if you want to keep the rest,” I informed him, flipping the bloodied wrench in my palm.
More breathing. More crying. More wishing he were already dead. “Really!” he cried. “I don’t know where we got the info. I’m just a foot
soldier!”
I rolled my eyes. “I’ve already encountered enough of Miguel’s foot soldiers to know where he’s hiding and how many of his men are across the border.”

More screaming stole his attention away as Scott continued questioning the other captives, hopefully creating more motivation for this stupid motherfucker to speak.
“I don’t know what else to tell you!”
Placing his index finger between the wrench, I squeezed it just as I had before.
“Preferably something that will spare you this finger. Otherwise I’ll just skip the questioning and move on to the fun part.”
I squeezed the clamps harder, drawing blood from the torn skin as it dripped into a puddle on the floor. It took another thirty minutes and all four digits to be torn from his hand before he finally went in the right direction of what I was looking for.
“There’s an extraction point!” he suddenly shouted just as I was about to start on the other hand.
I rolled my eyes. This was the best he could do? “What good is an extraction point when I can easily trace that helicopter you brought back to its original base?”
“M-Miguel will be there,” he sputtered.
“Max! You dirty piece of shit!” one of the other captives shouted out. “F-fuck you, Mick!” he shouted back.
I narrowed my eyes at what sounded like complete bullshit. “Why the fuck would Miguel be at an extraction point?” I would have expected his cowardly ass to remain hidden in his little fortress behind the safety of the Mexican border.
“Because we were s-supposed to bring you in alive. He wanted to be there f-for that himself.”
I released the clamp around his finger and stepped away, the laughter bouncing up from my chest impossible to contain. The audacity of these assholes. They thought they were going to take me alive? Hilarious.
“When and where?” I asked, holding the wrench up for emphasis.

“Twenty klicks south of here. Three hours from now.”
I grinned at the sudden turn of events. It looked like Miguel would have his final wish come true after all.
“Seems you get to live another three hours.”
Grinning, I stepped away to answer an incoming call. I placed the phone to my ear just as another scream ripped out from one of the captives.
“What.”
“Sir,” Eric said on the other line, practically panting. “There was another attack. You weren’t the only one.”
For fuck’s sake.
I sighed in aggravation, pinching the bridge of my nose to relieve the pressure growing behind my eyes. This day was never going to end.
“Where?” I asked, anger rising in my blood for the thirtieth time today.
But I didn’t expect to be hit with an odd sense of dread at his answer. “Daniel’s home, sir.”



I WOKE WITH A STIR, bolting upright from my position and clutching my heart to keep it from leaping out of my chest. The room immediately spun, my vision blurring while my head pounded something fierce. I quickly lay back down, flopping onto my side only to experience some serious soreness in my cheek. Wincing, I rubbed it gently, feeling some slight swelling as I slowly rolled onto my back.
What the fuck happened?
I closed my eyes, focusing on my deep breathing until the dizziness faded away, working to ignore the flaring pain in my hip that shot down my leg.
And then reality struck me.

Darren had drugged me. During the fight. During my one possible chance of getting out.
I felt the panic quickly sink in, fear and anguish running down my cheeks in heavy streams at the thought of what Darren might have discovered while I was unconscious. I could barely catch my breath as my blood pulsed with dread.
Breathe, Jaden. Just breathe. You don’t know anything yet.
But deep down, I already knew. My very state was proof enough. I could sense that my hair had already been washed and styled, the softness of it brushing underneath my jawline. My skin didn’t feel tight or caked in grime anymore, and I was wearing a new clean dress.
The signs of failure where all there, just as heavy and debilitating as the anguish radiating in my muscles and bones from the battle that had clearly been lost.
Attempting to regain some ground, I tried to train my focus on anything other than the tremors flowing through my body. Taking slow deep breaths, I wiped away my tears and slowly sat up to study the room I was in.
It was dark, and the bed beneath me was unfamiliar since it was so small. But the large presence in the corner was unmistakable, that black energy of his always palpable to my touch. And that was when I realized Matt’s plan had well and truly failed. Darren had survived. And I was not free.
Oh God. It was true. I was not free.
“You look scared, my defiant little queen.”
A cold chill shot its way up my spine, the tremors worsening with every silent second that past. Darren stepped forward from the shadows, his imposing stature dominating the small space, reminding me why I was such an idiot for thinking he wouldn’t survive. Reminding me of how goddamn foolish I was.

Had this been years earlier, I might have allowed my terror to sink in at the mere sight of him, my flight instinct activated to flee immediately. But like Darren had already said, it was my fight that always kept me in place to take him on.
Quickly analyzing his features, I searched for the triumphant sneer in his lips that would confirm my worst fears, any semblance of a devious victory that he would taunt me with. But I found none of that. Instead, all I saw was cold, dark fury.
What did this mean? Had Jason not been found? Had he even been there at all? Had my deception been discovered?
No. No, it couldn’t be. I had to believe Jason hadn’t been involved. There was no other explanation for that disaster of an assault. None of the gunmen even knew his name. Something had to have gone wrong.
Slowing my breathing down, I took several large breaths in through my nose to center myself, and then launched my emotions from panic to absolute volcanic anger.
“What the hell did you do?” I shouted from the bed. “Why did you drug me? We were in the middle of an attack, and you left me completely helpless! Why?!”
It only took a single stern look from him to force myself to quiet down, the stormy look in his eyes warning me to lower my voice and remember my place. But I wanted answers. Needed them desperately. And then a solid, heavy step forward had me wincing.
“I drugged you because I had no other choice!” he roared, the deep pitch in his tone causing my body to flinch. Darren rarely raised his voice, noticeably because he just didn’t need to, the coldness in his calm tone terrifying enough. But this time was different. “You deliberately disobeyed me again after I had just told you to run for safety. Instead, you chose to stay and fight, and then had the audacity to argue with me while I was correcting your near-fatal mistake!”

I could feel my teeth grinding to dust as I bit back my retort. Now that I knew I was still stuck here, I had some serious damage control to manage.
“You wanted to leave me buried under a house that had parts of it on fire! What the hell kind of strategy is that?” I argued. “And then you left me completely defenseless! What if you had lost the fight? I’d be completely fucked right now!”
“Watch your fucking mouth, little girl,” Darren growled, causing my back to stiffen. “I already explained to you what I expected and why, and that it was not up for debate. Yet you chose to defy me anyway.”
“I tried to find the panic room!” I continued desperately. “There was so much going on. Bullets were flying everywhere, parts of house had been blown apart, noise in every direction. Sorry if my navigation was a little off while I tried to find it!”
In three long strides, Darren grabbed me by my neck and hauled me up to slam my back against the wall above the iron headboard, my bare feet still digging into the mattress. We were practically eye level now, his face inches from mine as fury ripped his features into something vicious and predatory.
His grip tightened harshly when I started to struggle, the blood flow to my brain heavily compromised. My hands instinctively clawed at his wrist, using him as an anchor to hold myself up, but his arm never moved.
“Keep lying to me, Jaden. It’s doing you a world of favors,” he threatened, his voice deep with malice.
“I did try,” I croaked out on a broken whisper.
“You fucking failed is what you did,” he rasped. “Imagine my disappointment when I found you trapped under a fucking wall with five rifles pointed at your head. If I hadn’t gotten there in time, you would be fucking dead right now.”
I scoffed as I tried to reposition my neck in his grip, barely gaining a centimeter. “First, I have a 100 percent success rate,” I grated, “and now

I’m a failure. Just like that.”
I shuddered angrily at the truth, hating that he did have a point. Pinned under that wall frame, I was about to lose that fight had he not intervened when he did. I would have lost Camaro in the mix as well.
But what had followed next was an alarming display of swift and lethal brutality. The violence Darren was so skilled at left me frozen with near disbelief, accompanied by the horror of realizing he was still alive. He was so fast, so efficient, so goddamn deadly it terrified to me think Jason would ever last more than a few moments against him.
“That’s how failure works, you disobedient little brat,” he growled, squeezing tighter and making me wince. “Something you consistently do when it comes to following my orders. And now it’s costing you your safety and my fucking sanity!” His dark gaze bore down on me with an intensity I could feel, his energy searing my skin with the kind of wrath that made me want to shrink away instantly. “Apparently, I’ve gone too soft on you,” he murmured, his eyes scanning me with disapproval. “Clearly too lenient, too indulgent…and far too merciful. Evidently, you’re not nearly as afraid of me as you should be if you’re willing to defy me so easily. That ends today.”
With that, he released me and stepped away, letting me crumple to the bed like a rag doll while I struggled to regain my bearings. But now that he’d gotten his wrath out of his system—for now—I needed to know what he knew.
“What happened after you drugged me?” I asked, my voice grated by his bruising grip. “Who was it that attacked us?”
Darren was quiet as he turned back to study me, his eyes searching for any little clue my body might reveal to him. Sometimes he was too damn good at reading me and it scared the fucking shit out of me.
“Miguel’s attack on our home failed,” he stated plainly. “There were very little casualties on our side.” His flat tone was bored like he was

delivering the weather report instead of the result of the massive assault that nearly claimed my own life.
But there was one word that captivated my attention. One very special noun. Miguel’s attack. Not Matt’s. Not Jason’s. Miguel’s.
Thinking back on my conversation with Matt, he had refused me the very important details I needed to be prepared for this attack, like who the fuck was going to execute it. I assumed Jason would be involved since Matt said I could be free after the attack.
Why else would that even be a possibility if not for Jason to secure my rescue? But Darren would have to be killed in order for me to be free, yet here he was, standing like the dark omen of my fate.
What the hell had happened? What went wrong? Why had the operation failed? Why had they attacked ahead of schedule?
“How do you know it was Miguel and not Matt, or some other enemy you have?” I asked carefully.
Darren’s brow furrowed as he glared down at me, the shadow of suspicion darkening his eyes before he finally answered.
“Because I’m very good at motivating people to talk,” he replied. I nodded in acknowledgment. He did have a knack for that.
So if it was Miguel, I could see Matt teaming up with him, especially since he’d had a business relationship with his brother, Javier, before Darren had him killed.
“What happens now?” I asked dryly, my mind already exhausted from everything.
“I’m going to kill Miguel within the next hour. And you’re going back to the estate where you will stay until I say otherwise,” he said definitively. “I suggest you make peace with your position there because you won’t be leaving the grounds for a very long time. If ever.”
I felt a metaphorical door suddenly slam shut in my face, the lock deafening as it clicked into place. Back to square one, just like that. Back to

my original prison. And this time I knew—I knew I’d never get to leave it again.
Fuck.
I felt my entire body deflate into a dark void of nothing, the weight of hopelessness crushing my soul. Exhausted and broken, I laid my head against the pillow, utterly devastated by it all.
Absolutely nothing had gone according to plan. Not one damn thing. In fact, everything was worse now. If Darren successfully took Miguel out of the game, it was one less ally Matt and Jason could count on.
Was I really this stupid? This naive? Too eager and arrogant to see the potential flaws in Matt’s plan? Why did I even bother at this point? I couldn’t trust one goddamn thing that might actually save myself from this fucking nightmare I was trapped in.
I could feel Darren moving closer to me, his presence drawing me to him like the gravity of a black hole. But the closer he got, the harder it was to contain my impending tears.
I thought I had been so close. So fucking close. Or, fuck, maybe I had never even come close at all. Either way, I would never know. And the pain of it was like having a crater punched through my chest.
All I knew was that being drugged had prevented me from knowing the truth. Whether or not Jason had been there. Whether or not Matt could be trusted, which was a stupid question to begin with. Of course, I couldn’t trust him.
But if his illusive words held any kind of sway over the margins of my life then this failure was all the proof I needed to judge the truth.
While my brain tried to rationalize it all, my heart wanted nothing more than to deny it. I wanted to believe Jason would be there, and the only way to know was to fucking be there myself!
But considering everything that had happened, it was clear to me Jason couldn’t have been there at all. If he had been, I’d be waking up to a very

different situation than my current one.
And now I had to sit on my ass in isolation and figure out what the hell had happened that made everything go so wrong. I supposed in hindsight, I was glad Jason wasn’t there or had evaded Darren’s capture. I was sure Darren would have rubbed it in my face if he had finally caught him.
“Fine. But I’m going to bitch about it the whole time,” I stated, my voice flat and lifeless.
Darren moved away from the bed, grabbing his jacket off the side of a nearby chair and slipped it on.
“Bitch all you want, princess. The only thing it will change is the color of your ass. And you know how much I love to paint it.”
I cringed at the implication.
“At least now you’ll finally have all the chances you’ll need to fulfill your end of our first little bet you lost,” Darren said as he brushed his hands through his unruly hair.
I furrowed my brows. “What are you talking about?”
A tight grin formed in the corner of his mouth. “Babysitting Ella. You’ll be seeing a lot more of her when you get back.”
My brows knitted in confusion. “What? Why?”
His eyes turned grave as he lifted his gaze to mine. “Because Daniel’s home was attacked at the same time we were,” he replied, causing my body to stiffen with suspense. Had this been part of the plan?
“Are they okay?” At least let Katherine and Ella be okay. Fuck Daniel. “Ella is fine, but Katherine and Daniel were badly injured. They barely
made it out before their home was completely destroyed, and the majority of their staff were killed.”
My breath caught in my lungs, my heart frozen with horror for Katherine.
“So they’ll be coming to stay with us for a while until their house is rebuilt.”

I didn’t know why I was going to ask because I already knew the damn answer, but I needed to hear it from him.
“Do we know who attacked them?”
Darren’s features tightened into a scowl. “Take a wild fucking guess.”





42.

AT LEAST YOU TRIED.









The night was colder than usual. With the wind picking up as the moon appeared beyond the clouds, the night promised to be every bit as
pleasing as ever.
Scott and me, along with Antonio, Carlos, and Luis, my three soldiers best matching the description of the other soldiers we captured, all accompanied our last man standing, Marx.
We stayed hidden in the shadows of the extraction point, awaiting the helicopter that Miguel would apparently be riding in.
I didn’t understand why he wouldn’t just wait for the helicopter to transport me to his compound. But apparently, his ego required that he personally escort my dead ass back and serve me up in front of his men so he could claim the kill. Fucking pussy.
Tonight, I would end this pitiful war with the Spade family and get back to killing Matthew Rainer’s.
And maybe even finally start my own.
We didn’t have to wait long for the helicopter to arrive, the sound of its propellers giving us the signal we needed to ready ourselves. Unzipping the body bag, I lay down inside it and allowed Scott to zip it up. Once the

helicopter had landed, he heaved my dead weight over his shoulder and walked us out into the open.
“Christ, you weigh a fucking ton,” Scott muttered under his breath.
It was a bold move, but sometimes it took bold moves to win wars. And winning wars was my specialty.
Four taps against the back of my knee from Scott told me how many men were inside the helicopter. I suspected Miguel, two of his soldiers, and the pilot. Listening as the door slid open, I could hear my men climb inside before Scott gently dropped my body onto the floor of the chopper.
“Ha ha!” Miguel’s laughter was excited. “Look at this shit!”
I kept still as I felt the pilot fly the chopper up into the air, back to their base. Back on land, four armor-plated Hummers were following our tracking signal back to Miguel’s base to finish off whoever was still left.
“Ha! We got you, you stupid gringo fuck! I told you we could do it without those fucking Americanos!”
Americanos? What the fuck is he talking about?
Knowing full well he wouldn’t be able to resist for very long, Miguel got up from his seat to climb over the partition separating the pilot from the passengers. Judging by how quiet and spacious it felt in here, he had to be flying a pretty nice luxury helicopter.
Reaching for the zipper, he began to slowly pull it down, revealing parts of my would-be unconscious body. More laughter came from Miguel, his excitement almost as irritating as his laugh. But the moment he pulled the bag apart, I struck.
With a tight grip on my knife, I surged forward, the wild grin on my face impossible to hide. Miguel squealed in shock and horror as I grabbed the back of his head and forced my blade between his lips, instantly slicing into the corners of his mouth.
My move was the signal for Scott, Antonio, Luis, and Carlos to finish off the other two useless passengers in the back. Their throats were quickly

slashed while Scott climbed to the front of the cabin and pressed a gun to the back of the pilot’s head.
“Stay on course,” he ordered, his voice encouraging.
“You look surprised to see me, Miguel.” I snickered with a wide grin. The combination of rage, shock, and terror on his face was my prize at the end of this little competition. “Did you really think that pitiful display of an attack was enough to take me out?”
“Fuck you, Davi—”
Pulling the knife away, I sliced even deeper into the corners of his lips, blood flowing down his cheeks and chin just so I could slam my elbow into the side of his face, knocking his head against the half partition. I then grabbed him by the hair and smashed his face against the hard wood over and over until his blood splattered against my shirt.
“Who told you we’d be at that location?” I seethed, tightening my grip on his balding head.
Miguel’s response was a gurgling chuckle.
“Who!” I roared, pressing the knife just under his eye.
A bloody-toothed smile curved his mouth. “You really don’t know?” “Answer the fucking question!” Scott shouted from the cabin, his gun
still pointed at the clearly terrified pilot.
More laughter, more nonsense before Miguel finally spit out a name. “Matthew fucking Rainer, you gringo cunt!”
Son of a bitch.
I should have known that. But how did he? “You were always a shit—aaaaahhhh!!”
Miguel’s voice went from cocky to shocked as I dropped the knife to allow both my thumbs to drive into his eye sockets.
He screamed and squirmed violently as I wrapped my long fingers around his head and shoved my thumbs even deeper, his eyes turning to mush around my digits as blood squirted in every direction.

Scott chuckled from the cabin at the scene while the pilot looked like he was about to be sick. Removing my thumbs, Miguel continued to scream and writhe on the floor as he pressed his palms against his face and wildly kicking his feet around like he might actually strike something.
Grabbing my knife from the floor, I gripped his hair in my hand again and pulled him up to a sitting position, holding him steady. I then leaned in toward his ear as he continued to cry and groan.
“Al menos lo intentaste,” I told him, though I wasn’t sure if he could even hear me over his incessant screaming.
At least you tried.
The blade of my knife then slowly slid into the side of his throat, pressing in gently so as to draw it out for a few additional seconds. Miguel gurgled and choked as I removed the blade, allowing his blood to flow from his neck in heavy rivulets down his chest.
Dropping his dying body, I moved to the front of the cabin to slide into Miguel’s seat with a satisfied sigh.
“Just one more present to drop off,” I told Scott as he maintained his aim at the pilot.
The pilot’s shoulders shook the entire time as he maneuvered the chopper through the air and off to its home base. It wasn’t a long trip, only about fifteen minutes before the confines of a small compound could be seen in the distance.
“It’s there,” the pilot pointed.
“Hover over the main house,” I ordered. Turning back, I could see Luis and Antonio were already preparing the bomb that we were about to drop overhead. I wanted this shit finished once and for all. No mistakes this time. Once they had finished, Luis freed the latch of the side door, allowing a gust of wind to blow through the cockpit. When we were perfectly over the
compound, I gave them the signal and nodded.

Releasing the package, the bomb flowed through the air under a parachute as it descended into the middle of the base. After Scott had directed the pilot to clear from the blast radius, he pressed the ignition to trigger the bomb.
The blast rocked through the compound, destroying everything with a heavy storm of fire. Watching Miguel’s guards run around while their bodies were covered in flames was truly satisfying, which only increased when our land convoy entered the premises to take out what was left and clean house.
“You know, I think we could lose a little more weight while we’re at it,” I suggested to Scott.
He nodded, then turned to direct Antonio, Luis, and Carlos, instructing them to toss the slain passengers and Miguel’s body out of the helicopter to land within the confines of the explosion and burning buildings.
“Put it on autopilot,” I told the pilot.
Once he had it securely engaged, Scott yanked the front of his head back against the seat and quickly dragged a blade across his throat from behind. Leaving the man to bleed out, Scott reached over to open the pilot’s door and pushed him out of his seat, his body plummeting to the fiery ground beneath us.
Maneuvering quickly, I placed myself into the pilot’s seat, changing some settings on the controls before disengaging the autopilot and flying us the hell out of there.
A sense of pride floated through the cabin now that the war had been won. But things were never that easy. I may have closed the door on one war, but there was still one left that I needed to take care of.
Matthew Rainer was a very, very dead man.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN.









My fist slammed against the side of his jaw, the blow knocking him clear off his ass and sending him straight to the concrete floor. I got in two more hits, busting his lip and eye before strong hands finally gripped me
and yanked me back.
“Jason, stop!” Romero demanded as Anthony and Derick held me back from completely demolishing Matthew Rainer into the fucking ground.
“You lying piece of shit!” I roared, raging against their hold as Rainer spit blood onto the floor. “You fucked up that entire operation and betrayed our agreement. I should fucking end you right now!”
Rainer said nothing as his hand clutched his bruising jaw and slowly stumbled to a stand. The old warehouse we were in didn’t hold much light, but I could still clearly see the glare on his face from the accusation.
“I had no idea they were going to attack ahead of schedule,” he argued. “I had to scramble to get my own team together in less than an hour to coordinate our attack at the same time, and it was almost damn near impossible. Either someone had miscommunicated something or Miguel was an even bigger fool than I thought.”

“Bullshit!” I retorted. “We never should have fucking trusted your word. I should have just infiltrated the suite myself and gotten Jaden the fuck out of there. We have the goddamn cloaking device. She doesn’t need to be there anymore.”
“But then who would have convinced Darren to go to the country estate, genius?” Rainer countered. “I’m surprisingly impressed she actually managed to do it in the first place. And besides, we already agreed you can’t be her contact anymore. You can barely control yourself as it is. The last time you saw her you nearly fucked everything up and almost went back for her. We all agreed it’s best you stay away for now, remember?”
I groaned aloud, because yeah, I fucking remembered. I remembered the inferno that burned deep in my chest as I watched Jaden walk into that beachside restaurant with him. As beautiful as she looked, I caught the slight limp in her step and the way he took her hand to help her inside.
It was just a single glance from the driver’s seat of a passing car, but five minutes later that was all it took for me to whip the car around and go back, even if it was just for a glimpse of her shadow.
Thankfully, Derick had been with me at the time and successfully brought me back to reality, but I’d gotten us about fifty yards away from that restaurant before I realized I’d be driving myself straight to my own damn death, and maybe even Derick’s.
That was when I knew I couldn’t be trusted with being that close to her anymore. That first time in Rome had nearly broken me. I never wanted to have to leave her behind again. So I just needed to stay away. For now.
“As much as I hate to admit it, Jason, he’s right,” Romero conceded. “We need Jaden to be there if we’re going to have any shot at taking this guy down. She made the attack possible in the first place. We may need her to do it again. Remember, she isn’t the only one we’re trying to save.”
I shook my head at Romero, knowing damn well we were making a mistake with this fucking guy.

“He doesn’t give a shit about any of that,” I reminded him. “As long as he gets Daniel, he won’t care if our plans fail or not. And he couldn’t even get the stupid fucker!”
Matt’s eyes flashed with fury as he took a step toward me. “Why the fuck would I want that mission to fail? I need Darren just as dead as you do to avoid his retaliation. That fucker will never stop until someone puts a bullet in his head.”
I scowled at him, my fists tightening as I imagined blackening one of his eyes next.
“Who the fuck knows with you,” I retorted. “We’ve been at this with you for months, and we’ve gotten no closer to ending this. Your intel and plans are proving to be inadequate and unreliable.”
Rainer shook his head as he glared back at me. “Believe what you want, it makes no difference to me, but the agreement remains the same. Either we can work together as a team and coordinate our efforts or we can go at it separately and most likely fail.”
My gut wrenched, knowing I had been this close to ending all of this, and this motherfucker still had the balls to deny it. I had one goal and one goal only.
Get. Jaden. Out.
That time had finally come. And then it was gone before I even knew it.
I could only imagine Jaden’s devastation right now. And it was gutting me from the inside out.
Derick grunted. “What’s the point of coordinating our efforts if your resources are unreliable? We just lost a huge advantage because you put your faith in the wrong enemy,” he scolded as he and Anthony released my arms from their hold.
“Like I said, if I had known Spade was going to attack the country estate a day earlier, I would have informed you sooner.”

“And why would they reject our assistance?” Anthony asked, his arms crossing over his chest as he stared Rainer down. “We could have ended that son of a bitch right then and there, and instead, Davis ended 80 percent of Miguel’s cartel the very same night. Some great collaboration that was.”
Rainer shrugged with a heated glare. “Apparently, I miscalculated Miguel’s ego. He was a prideful moron with no sense in his little coked-out brain. He wasn’t exactly a fan of accepting aid from what he considered a bunch of self-righteous gringos.”
I groaned and threw my hands into the air, enraged and in disbelief at the new bit of information. It might have been useful to know before agreeing to work with a drug lord who preferred to personally test his own product every week.
“Now he fucking tells us,” I said, ready to rip my damn hair out. “Why didn’t you warn us of that before?”
“And jeopardize the collab? You all were already suspicious of each other. I didn’t want to make it worse!” Rainer explained.
“A lot of fucking good that did!” I shouted in retort. “Any other surprise reveals you’d like to share tonight?”
Rainer’s mouth twisted into a scowl. “Other than the fact that I agree on the self-righteous part? No. Though I don’t think that should come as a surprise to any of you.”
“Self-righteous? Seriously?” Romero challenged, taking a threatening step toward Rainer.
He sneered, blood tainting his otherwise perfectly white teeth. “That’s right. You’re all high on your own heroic nobility, but deep down, you’re nothing but a bunch of bloodthirsty murderers trying to even a score. Just like me.”
“Don’t try to compare us,” I barked. “We’re nothing like you.”
He cocked a brow as the corner of his mouth lifted. “Oh, you don’t think so? I know your body count, Jason. What you did to Darren’s

surveillance team in Chicago? Even I didn’t anticipate that. Your bloodlust is getting out of control.”
I advanced on him, ready to knock his head off his fucking shoulders. I didn’t care how many bodies I had to stack to end this, I would not be deterred.
“Careful, Rainer, or I’ll add you to it,” I snarled, loving nothing more than to follow through on it.
I didn’t give a single fuck what this manipulative piece of shit thought of me. His judgment was meaningless. I wasn’t doing this to prove something to anyone, including myself.
I was doing it to get my fucking woman back. And if that meant I had to get my hands dirty, then I’d stain them until they were good and black before I let myself give up on her.
“Please,” Rainer taunted, dropping his chin. “You’ve accepted my weapons, my intel, and my funding. I doubt it’ll be much longer before you start accepting my employ once this is over.”
“Once this is over, you better pray we never cross paths again,” I shot back.
“This is just a means to an end,” Anthony interrupted, side-eyeing me. “You need our skills and ambition, and we need your resources and connections. Anything else outside of that is insignificant.”
“Fair enough,” Rainer stated, his gaze unwavering. “But we’ll need to come up with a new strategy now that Spade is out of the picture.”
Romero tilted his head as he narrowed his gaze. “What did you have in mind?”
“We need to attack more of Darren’s bigger resources,” Rainer answered. “Bleed him dry. Disrupting the auction and rerouting the funds was good but not enough. There’s a small cartel in the Colombian jungle called the Lobos. Darren supplies them with money, guns, and women, and

they supply him with the best cocaine crop there is. If we take them out, that’s a serious chunk of income gone, and it will rattle his other suppliers.”
“And you want us to be the ones to take them out,” Derick stated with an eye roll.
“No, I’ll handle that operation,” Rainer answered. “Consider the information a sign of good faith.”
My mouth formed a straight line while my gaze narrowed, my suspicions solidifying in my brain.
“And how exactly do you plan on executing that?” I asked, folding my arms across my chest.
“I’ll be calling in a family favor,” he replied, his eyes meeting mine. “You’ve got another resource we don’t know about?” Romero asked, his
brow arching.
“Just trust me on this.”
I rolled my eyes and dropped my arms. This guy could not be fucking serious.
“We also need to do a better job of disrupting his weapons supply. Our isolated attacks to avoid detection were too small to really be effective. Now that our failed attack is over, we don’t have to contain the noise anymore. It’s time to ditch the subtlety.”
“Finally,” Derick griped. “I’d say it’s time to kick it up a notch.”
“The underground brothels he has in Vegas, the ones disguised as exclusive massage parlors that host much darker and more sinister natures. They’re the most lucrative. You can even get your kicks off knowing you’ll be ‘rescuing’ some of the whores when you dismantle it all.”
“Watch it,” Romero warned.
Rainer rolled his eyes. “Regardless. If you take out those brothels and disrupt the recruiting process, it will break down another source of revenue, not to mention diminish some of his ability to launder money.”

“Fine, we’ll take care of them,” Romero answered for all of us. “What else?”
“Darren also has an agreement with the manager of an underground fighting ring consisting of mostly women in Vegas. Raiding it will show that even his business partners aren’t safe and may dissuade others from starting new contracts with him.”
Derick didn’t look impressed but nodded anyway. “I’ll look into that one.”
“Good,” Rainer acknowledged. “Some of Darren’s shipments are transported off the coast to a warehouse in Tijuana. Tipping off the Mexican cartels about that potential payday might be worth the trouble, especially now that they probably know Darren took out Miguel. His allies might want a little payback.”
Anthony nodded. “This is good.”
“What about a server farm?” I asked, catching Rainer’s eye. “Jaden mentioned a server farm somewhere that would be detrimental to his corporation if someone were to tamper with it.”
Rainer blinked, then straightened to fold his arms across his chest. “He has dozens of those all across the country.”
Of course, he does.
“She mentioned a company called Digital Frontiers. That they might be managing the farms,” I added.
Rainer dipped his chin as he stepped around the room. “It’s run by a man named Patrick Edgar. He’s been managing that company for the past ten years.”
“Do you have access to this man?” Derick asked.
He puffed a breath of air with humor on his lips as he cocked his head. “Not anymore.”
I shook my head in agitation. Shocker.

“Fine. We’ll have Miller get to work on it,” I said, nodding to Derick in agreement.
“Yeah, except here’s the problem,” Rainer interjected. “They manage some of my shit too. Shit Darren doesn’t know about.”
I could feel my knuckles nearly bursting through my skin from how hard I was clenching my fist. This man seriously only cared about himself.
“Relax, Rainer. This is just investigative work,” Anthony added. “No one will know we were even there.”
“They	knew	you	were	there	when	you	attacked	the	auction’s mainframe,” Rainer shot back.
“By then it was too late,” Romero countered. “And we got exactly what we needed.”
“You got lucky is what you got,” Rainer snapped.
I pinched the bridge of my nose as the tension grew between my eyes. “Regardless, we’ll get in, get what we need, and let you know what we
find,” I retorted.
Rainer sighed dramatically. “Fine. But even if you’re able to disrupt his legal businesses, he still has plenty of fail-safes to fall back on. We’ll need to target those as well.”
My eyes shot over to Romero, who met my gaze with the same concern I was already feeling. How much more information was this guy really withholding?
“What other fail-safes?” I asked.
“Darren has multiple unguarded safehouses hidden all over the country. Each safehouse contains an underground vault with at least ten million dollars in cash. It might be humorous to have him continue funding his own demise.”
I cocked a brow at the new information. “That sounds like a huge operation. We’d have to attack several at once to avoid detection before he ups the security for the others.”

Rainer nodded. “Agreed. Which is why the cash will be an incentive to hire more mercenaries to assist you. Your ability to recruit has been impressive, but your little boy band isn’t enough. You need to build an army. Obtaining this cash will do it.”
I exhaled a short breath as I mulled over his suggestions. The thought alone was exhausting, but if it brought me closer to Jaden, then I’d fucking do it a hundred times over.
I just hoped my team’s need to take Davis down was as strong as my need to get Jaden the fuck away from him. But after everything we’d done already, I couldn’t doubt them.
“Fine. Let’s plan this out,” I said.
For the next several hours, we formulated our strategies based on Rainer’s intel. I didn’t want to trust the fucker, but what choice did I have? We still had the one thing incentivizing him, so it would be foolish for him to waste his efforts.
With plans now in motion once again, we left the warehouse under the cover of dark, our black SUV parked securely next to a shipping container. But Rainer’s annoying voice was calling my name before I made it even three steps outside.
“Jason, aren’t you forgetting something?” he called, his tone taunting.
I glanced up at the night sky, gathering strength and the will not to beat him to death, and grabbed my wallet from my back pocket.
“You know, I’m not so sure you deserve it, considering your end of the last deal had been a complete fucking disaster.”
A low growl emanated from his chest. “I don’t care. This part of the agreement still stands. Now hand it over.”
Shaking my head, I opened my wallet and handed him the single folded picture of the pretty little blonde, the grimace on my face impossible to conceal.

Rainer’s eyes softened as he reveled over the photo, his lips forming into a half smile when he saw Kayla had held up her middle finger for the camera this time.
After our first meeting, we refused to allow him another second in her presence, no matter how much he tried to bargain for it. But giving him little glimpses of her at each meeting was usually an effective way of keeping him in line. Usually.
This little transaction also allowed Kayla to safely express herself to him without having to worry about retaliation. She could be impressively creative when she wanted to be.
The fucking fool craved her pictures like a goddamn junkie, and as long as we kept giving them to him, he’d leave her alone. But I wasn’t a moron. I knew as soon as all of this was over, he’d be gunning straight for her again. And I’ll be damned if I let that happen.
His grin still in place, Rainer pocketed the picture and met my glare. “Always a pleasure, Jason,” he sneered, then turned to leave, heading
for his own ride out of here.
Watching his figure disappear into the darkness, I knew without a shadow of a doubt that man would not survive this war.
I’d fucking make sure of it.





44.

SNUFFED.









I was a fool. A goddamn fucking fool. A stupid little girl with zero perception of the world around her. Who held on to stupid dreams that were pathetically lost to her wildest imagination. Who trusted monsters that
fed on lies and misery.
Katherine’s hand was cold in my own, the steady beeping of the heart monitor next to her bed bringing me some relief that she was stable and recovering. But you wouldn’t know that just by looking at her.
Angry second-degree burns marred the side of her face, extending to patches on her chest, arms, and legs. She had bruising and deep lacerations just about everywhere while her broken wrist was wrapped in a cast, resting at her side.
Katherine’s bodyguards stared at me uncomfortably from their chairs against the wall, their stiff statures and hard expressions making me feel incredibly unwanted. And Camaro could feel it as she sat by my feet, her watchful eyes tracking every movement they made.
If they moved too quickly, she would rise to a stand and groan with disdain at them. The guards would roll their eyes and go back to their

business. But they could go fuck themselves. My heart was too busy breaking just looking at the state of Katherine.
And between those jagged cracks, fury seeped through to glue them back together.
Matt had done this. This was his fault. I’d stupidly assumed he was going to be a part of that fight, but he had only used it as another play to separate Darren from Daniel, giving him the chance to attack without Darren’s interference. And still, he fucking failed.
Jackass.
But it wasn’t without casualties. While Daniel had survived, a bullet had grazed his skull deep enough to cause brain damage. What kind, we didn’t yet know, but it would eventually manifest once he woke up from surgery. For all we knew, he could be a completely different person. Maybe he’d finally grow a fucking conscience.
Thankfully, by some miracle, Ella had made it out unscathed. Her nannies had all been killed in the attack, so she was currently being cared for by Darren’s staff until a new nanny could be secured. But she didn’t know where her mommy and daddy were and had been asking for them.
I felt like such an idiot. Matt had even warned me that trust didn’t exist in this world, yet I chose to work with him anyway. And what did it accomplish? What did I get out of it? Absolutely nothing.
In fact, Darren was actually stronger for it now that Miguel was officially out of the picture. And I had put myself in an even worse position when I’d gotten caught ignoring Darren’s orders to run so I could ensure my own escape like a goddamn moron.
What a colossal fucking disaster that had been.
And now I was going to pay for it. I could feel that sinister dark cloud hovering just beyond the horizon, slowly creeping toward me so it could rain down a storm of hellfire.
Just another Tuesday.

I didn’t know why I continued to allow myself to hope, but some part of me still stupidly clung to the idea of freedom. Of living my life without every bit of it being controlled by a sadistic bloodthirsty psychopath who fed off my tears and screams.
His oppression was a weight that was getting harder and harder to carry, my entire body so close to caving in just to relieve some of the pressure. But if I did that, I feared I’d be stuck under his thumb so tightly I’d never be able to move again.
I’d never been more grateful to have the entire bed to myself last night after I’d been dropped off at the estate. By the time the sun rose this morning, my pillows were soaked with hours-worth of tears.
I’d long ago accepted that crying was therapeutic now. A necessity. A form of survival and self-soothing. Keeping my feelings pent up was just a disaster waiting to happen. I needed to expel them as soon as I possibly could.
Between my crushed hopes of escape and wondering what had gone wrong, I had been fearing the worst—that the reason I hadn’t found Jason was because he’d already been killed in the fight. I just hadn’t come across his body yet. And neither had Darren.
For all I knew, Jason could have been buried under all that debris, and I would never have known. He could have perished in an explosion that would have decimated his body beyond recognition.
Would Darren’s men even know his body if they found it? Would his body even be recognizable? Would they even care to check the dead left behind? And if they didn’t look, then there was no way in hell Darren would ever find out that Jason had been involved, and neither one of us would ever know if he was still alive or not.
And not knowing was absolutely killing me inside.
I had no idea what to do now. I felt lost. Everything just seemed so goddamn hopeless, and I felt fucking useless being trapped in this house

again. I’d have to figure something out—find some way to cause chaos on the inside. Maybe keep Darren distracted somehow.
But given what I knew was coming my way, I had no idea what kind of stamina I’d have afterward.
Fuck, my body shook just thinking about it. “Jaden? What are you still doing here?”
Turning my head, I looked back to see Sid standing near the doorway with a concerned expression on his face. When I confirmed he was alone, I turned back around.
“Someone should be here with her when she wakes up,” I answered. “That’s sweet of you,” he replied, stepping farther into the room,
stopping in front of Katherine’s bed. “She’ll be alright though. It’s Daniel I’m worried about.”
I almost scoffed. Fuck Daniel.
“How is he?” I asked, feigning concern to mask my morbid curiosity.
Sid exhaled deeply like he was exhausted. “Incredibly lucky,” Sid replied. “The bullet grazed the frontal lobe, so he won’t lose any major bodily functions.” Sid paused like he wanted to say more but chose to ponder it instead.
“I sense there’s a but somewhere in there.” My eyes rolled up to meet his gaze, his chin tucked in his hand as he stared down at Katherine.
“I have no idea what kind of person he’ll be when he wakes up,” he mused with a sigh. “The frontal lobe is responsible for cognitive function. Our emotions, decision-making, self-control, and behavior are all controlled by the frontal lobe. And a small piece of it is now missing. The consequences of that could be devastating for a man like him.”
I contemplated that for a moment, the hope of opportunity snaking its way back into my mind. You had to be smart to survive in this world, and if Daniel lacked the brain tissue responsible for ensuring his survival, then that could be an interesting fire to stoke.

“But we won’t know until he wakes up,” I added in confirmation.
Sid nodded before clearing his throat. “Should be in the next couple of hours.”
I stretched my stiff neck, rubbing my shoulder as I did. “Good thing he’s got a great neurosurgeon,” I commented with a smirk.
Sid grunted as he dipped his chin.
“How long have you been down here?” he asked me. “Too long,” one of the guards angrily answered for me. I rolled my eyes. “I don’t know, a few hours?”
Sid looked at his watch and frowned. “It’s past lunchtime. When did you last eat?”
I paused for a moment, not realizing the time. I used to have people who did that for me, who directed me throughout the day. But with Clive and Owen gone and Carla busy with assisting in the rehiring of all of Daniel’s staff, I was officially on my own for the first time in a long time.
I wonder how long that will last.
“Breakfast, I guess,” I finally responded.
Sid sighed. “You better go eat before Darren finds out.”
I grimaced at the thought of upsetting him again. Though he should be in a pretty chipper fucking mood given his recent victory. I didn’t need to give him a reason to upset that balance.
“Have you spoken to him today?” I asked. “About thirty minutes ago. Why?”
“I was just wondering if he said when he would be back.”
Sid shook his head. “Whatever amount of time you measure ‘soon’ to be,” he answered. “So I would suggest you get moving.”
I exhaled a deep breath in disappointment. “Yeah, okay,” I relented, grasping Katherine’s hand tightly before letting it go and standing.
“I’ll watch over her for a bit. Go on,” Sid said, folding his arms as he stared down at Katherine.

“Thank you,” I said sincerely, momentarily locking my gaze with his before heading out of the infirmary toward the elevator. I’d seen this place way too often for my liking as it was.
The elevator doors dinged and slid open, allowing Camaro and me to step in and ride back up the short distance to the main floor. Staring down at my wedding rings, I twisted them absentmindedly around my fingers, eyeing the sharp edges of the cut while appreciating the fire of the diamond as it sparkled under the elevator light.
It took billions of years under intense heat and pressure for the earth to create something so tough and resilient. Yet it only took a few hours for humans to completely reshape it into something else, something brilliant and pleasing to the eye. It made me think of how often Darren had reshaped me, and then I wondered if he would ever be finished.
Before the elevator doors had barely opened, I glanced up, and my eyes immediately widened. A hand snatched out to clench around my throat and shoved me back against the elevator wall. The doors closed shut with a ding as the elevator descended, Camaro’s uncertain barked whine bouncing up from the floor.
Finding my courage, I willed myself to look up into the dark and vicious blue eyes that pierced back at me. Darren’s gaze was shadowed, a dark storm brewing behind the fierce coldness he was emitting.
But then I realized I was still breathing without strain, his hand having yet to tighten around my neck. Instead, he just held me in place as the elevator stopped at another floor lower than the infirmary, a floor I didn’t know existed.
“Where are we going?” I dared to ask, my voice low with caution.
Darren’s jaw tightened, the muscle flexing as his fingers curled around my throat.
“You’ll see,” he answered just before the elevator dinged and the doors opened.

Circling to the back of my neck, Darren wrenched me out of the elevator, whistling for Camaro to follow. The doors opened into a dimly lit hallway. There were no other doors, and the hallway seemed to stretch on pretty far. It must have been some sort of tunnel that connected the main house to somewhere else on the property.
But as Camaro’s claws clicked against the white tiles, my stomach clenched with dread. I knew something bad was going to happen, either to me or to someone else, probably me. But if I was the target, Camaro was usually removed to avoid her trained interference. When I wasn’t the target, she wasn’t exactly dismissed either, her presence more inconsequential than anything else. But it seemed this time that Darren actually wanted her involved. And that made me even more nervous.
“Darren, what’s going on?”
“Quiet,” he clipped, his eyes focused on the path ahead.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
The tunnel seemed to go on for ages, but well before it ended, we finally stopped at a door on our right. Darren pressed his thumb into a small screen beside a security panel. The door then clicked open, and Darren pushed me inside, waiting for Camaro to cross the threshold before shutting it behind us.
I blinked as I observed the room around me, its familiarity hitting me like a punch to the gut. I hated this room. It was the underground chamber of the “shack” that Darren utilized for some of his more gruesome “activities” that I was lucky enough to witness at times. The place made my stomach sour, the scent of blood and bleach always tainting the air.
But the room wasn’t barren like it usually was. There was a plain white mattress laid out on the floor in one of the corners, with a bright spotlight pointed at it and a camera placed on a tripod. About ten feet away sat two sturdy-looking metal dog cages placed about one foot apart from each other.
Oh God, what the fuck is this?

In the opposite corner, another camera and spotlight were also set up and pointing at an old wooden chair that was clearly bolted to the floor. A small metal table stood against the corner wall with silver-looking instruments laid out.
In front of both settings, a large metal table was bolted down in the middle and allowed for a perfect vantage point of both scenes.
“What the hell is this?” I asked as I struggled to pull away from Darren’s grip.
Without answering, he just shoved me forward and pressed my upper body onto the large metal table. Three seconds later, my wrists were forced down onto the frigid tabletop, my cuffs magnetized to the metal. Fighting against the magnetic pull, I only managed to move my wrists a single centimeter, the strength of the cuffs impeccable for their size.
Darren stepped away and walked over to one of the cages, opening the door and whistling for Camaro. She followed the command and settled into the cage without complaint, lying on her belly while her tongue peeked between her teeth. Darren crouched down and placed something around her neck before shutting the cage door.
“What did you just do?” I asked, failing to hide the panic in my voice.
He ignored me as he came back around to the table and stood directly behind me. A few seconds later, I could hear people coming down the stone steps of the shack, the sounds of a struggle echoing throughout the room. Scott came into view first, leading the way as two guards dragged a woman down the steps, followed by another two carrying another woman in the same manner.
Both of the women seemed to be somewhat drugged as their struggles were pathetically minimal as they were carried away to the opposite corners of the room. One was dropped onto the mattress in the corner, the two men not even needing to hold her down as a chain bolted to the floor was wrapped around her neck and padlocked closed.

It was difficult to tell her age with her matted brown hair covering much of her face, but she looked deathly skinny under the baggy T-shirt and shorts that hung from her small body.
The second woman, a blonde, looked a bit younger but had a much heavier build than the brunette. They actually had to squish her into the small chair before tying her limbs down with scratchy-looking rope.
When both women seemed to be properly arranged, all but one guard left, the other moving to stand by the camera near the crying blonde, seemingly waiting for his next set of orders. Scott then turned around to nod at Darren and my stomach immediately dropped to my feet.
Ah, fuck.
I could hear Darren release a heavy breath from behind me before his steps carried him to the front of the table so I could see him clearly. With his hands in his pockets, he stared down at me with a blank expression I couldn’t read worth a damn.
“Do you know what snuff films are, Jaden?”
I closed my eyes and sighed, turning my head away as my stomach soured, hoping to regain some composure before answering him.
“Yeah,” I replied with a nod. “I know what snuff films are.”
You mean murder porn.
“Good,” Darren said. “Daniel used to run quite the little production set at his home, but since it’s been burned to the ground, we’ve had to improvise a temporary location to keep up with the demand of his clients.”
Clients?
“Daniel has clients that actually pay to watch people get murdered? Seems like a waste of money when they can just watch slasher movies,” I commented.
Darren smirked. “They don’t pay just to watch, Jaden. They pay for their production,” he replied darkly. “Specifically, just for them. They hand us the script, and we make it happen. There’s no mass distribution or

reproduction, no marketing scheme or promotion. Just a single tape, no editing or copies. It’s an incredibly simple process.”
I internally groaned with disgust. “Sounds too simple.”
Darren shrugged. “Not everything has to be complicated.” He turned around and nodded to the man still patiently waiting by the camera. On command, he stepped into action, securing a black ski mask over his head that depicted a white skull on the face.
The second the terror washed over the blonde’s face, I found myself yanking against my restraints.
“Argh! Why do I need to be here! Haven’t I witnessed enough torture for you?!”
Darren turned around to stare down at me, a knowing look in his eyes. “Because I’m hoping these will have a much more effective impact on
you,” he answered. “I know how much physical pain you can take and how the threat of it doesn’t seem to inspire your obedience anymore. And while I thoroughly enjoy beating and fucking that stubborn willfulness out of you, the circumstances have changed. I can no longer afford to have you thinking you’ll just take your whipping and move on. Not when you’re putting your life in jeopardy because of it.”
I gaped up at him, disbelief and horror blurring my vision at what he was implying.
“It’s time I reinstalled a healthy dose of fear in you, to remind you of who you belong to and what I’m capable of.” I felt my stomach roil with anxiety as he glared at me intently, the pure malice radiating from his cold gaze making me shiver. “I told you that you had disobeyed me for the last time, and I meant it. There will be no more leniency. From now on, your transgressions will be paid for by another, and you will watch every second of it until it finally sinks into your head that disobedience is no longer an option, starting today.”

Darren nodded at one of the other men, who immediately moved to stand behind the camera and pressed record.
What happened next was a scene that rivaled the movie Hostel. This poor woman was systematically cut apart, piece by piece. Her nails, her toes, her tongue, even some of her teeth had been slowly removed to create the greatest amount of suffering.
Only when he started to remove the rolls of skin from her stomach did she finally bleed out, and even then, her torturer didn’t stop. He took her apart like a puzzle and unceremoniously dumped what was left of her into a giant trash bin.
Throughout the entire scene, I couldn’t seem to catch my breath, my heart pounding into the metal table below it as my body shook with horror.
Every time I closed my eyes, every time I looked away, Darren would activate my collar and shock me until I returned my gaze. He had to do it three separate times before I finally found a brick in the corner behind the scene to focus on instead. But averting my sight barely helped compared to what I could still blatantly hear and smell.
Her screams were deafening, the shrill sound sharp with so much pain, it made my stomach churn with nausea. I’d never been so grateful to forget to eat. I was honestly surprised Camaro hadn’t reacted more than she did, but she was trained to ignore screaming unless it was mine.
But while I was forced to watch the atrocity carried out in front of me, it sickened me even more knowing that someone had paid for these specific requests. Someone had not only paid for her to die this way, but they also paid to have it filmed so they could enjoy it as often as they pleased.
What had this girl done to deserve such a horrific death? Who was she to the person who demanded such agony? Did Darren even know? Did he even care to ask?
“Who was she?” I finally managed to croak out, my voice barely a broken whisper.

I could feel Darren’s gaze turn to me as I watched her executioner wash away the blood from the chair, walls, and floor with a hose down the drain. When his task was done, he packed up his tools and left without a second glance.
“The client’s niece. Evidently, she didn’t like her very much.” My brows rose. She?
Oh my God. A woman had conjured up that nightmare?
I had no right to be surprised. People were evil. And evil had no gender. “As for the other one, apparently her husband has finally had enough of
her embarrassing drug habit and constant unfaithfulness.”
My eyes shot over to the brunette who was currently huddled on the mattress, her eyes closed and her hands over her ears. Her entire body was shaking as she quietly cried into the mattress.
Dread weighed me down at the idea of having to watch her tortured execution as well, my body shaking at the thought of enduring more.
“Darren,” I said, my gaze lingering on the metal table. “You’ve made your point.”
Scott turned in the corner of my view to glance back at Darren. He then nodded, and placed his phone at his ear as he headed back up the stairs, leaving us alone with just the crying women still chained to the dirty mattress.
I could feel Darren’s eyes on me, hovering over my body with the kind of judgment you could feel scratching against your skin.
“Have I?” he asked, his voice a low taunt as his steps echoed across the floor.
I nodded. “I get it. Please, I don’t want to see any more. I’ve seen enough death this past week to last me a lifetime.”
His leisurely steps continued until I could feel him standing right behind me. And then he lowered himself to my ear. “See, I’m not sure you have,” he murmured, that soft tone full of malicious deceit.

“I have,” I rasped firmly.
“Would you prefer the basement instead?”
I paused, my blood stalling in my veins at his alternative offering. Fear crept into my lungs, making it difficult to breathe as dark memories assaulted my psyche. I’d seen plenty of torture and murder, but what I just witnessed was far worse than anything I’d ever encountered. But every time I went into that godforsaken basement, I came out a completely different person, a half person.
Was that better? This woman would die by the script Darren had been given regardless of my transgressions. It was a gruesome sentence to witness, but it would be a much shorter one than what I would endure in the basement.
I sighed in exhausting defeat, resting my forehead against the cold metal table.
A soft laugh left Darren’s throat, his hand tracing down my spine, making me tremble.
“The fact that you even have to think about it is all the answer I need.” And then he lifted the back of my skirt and ripped my thong away. The sound of his belt buckle had my well-conditioned pussy clenching as he suddenly kicked my legs apart and entered me.
I gasped at the intrusion, my body not quite ready but yielding to his cock relatively quickly.
“You say I’ve made my point, but I’d like to drive it a little deeper before we move on to the next one,” he groaned, his hands on my hips and thrusting in hard for good measure. “From now on, you will do exactly as I say when I say it, or you will witness these same acts over and over again until you finally understand what obedience means.” His cock stretched me completely, plunging in and out to hit the exact spot that usually drove me insane with need.

“Ah!” I cried out, my body frozen in place as Darren fucked me into the table, that twisted pleasure building at a sickening rate.
After what I just witnessed, pleasure should be the last thing I could achieve, but that was trauma for you. Nothing ever made sense.
Darren suddenly snaked his hand through my hair and yanked my head back. “Do you understand?” he growled, keeping an even pace as my pussy clenched around him.
“Yes,” I gasped as I struggled to catch my breath.
“Who do you belong to?” he rumbled as he slammed into me, the remnants of an orgasm beginning to blossom.
“You! Ah!”
He fucked me harder, faster, driving me insane until I was moaning and gasping, desperate for release so this would end.
“Tell me you love me,” he commanded, his voice thick with lust and dominance, making me wince from the pain of his demand.
I groaned and cried, wishing I could be anywhere else but here. Wishing I had just died in the attack instead.
When I didn’t answer fast enough, he slapped me against the side of my ass so hard I almost screamed.
“Now!” he roared down at me. I flinched internally, despising the very existence of those fucking words.
“I love you,” I sobbed, my fingernails digging scratches into the metal.
Darren yanked my hair even harder. “Louder!” he snarled, his thrusts becoming punishing in their pursuit as hot tears ran down my cheeks.
“I love you!” I wailed, my body broken with the despair of my life, desperation splintering my soul.
Darren suddenly shifted his angle and fucked me straight into a tidal wave of painful pleasure, my entire body seizing and locking in place as my breath caught in my throat. I could feel him coming inside me as liquid heat

filled my core, my pussy spasming around his cock until all my energy had been drained.
I flopped back onto the table the second he released my hair, my chest heaving in rapid succession. And then suddenly, I was able to move my wrists again.
But then my attention was immediately diverted to Darren’s arm wrapping under my hips and hauling me off the table. I couldn’t help but go limp as he carried me over to the cage next to Camaro’s.
Lifting the top lid, he forced me inside, my body barely fitting within its small confines.
“Darren, wait, please,” I gasped, still struggling to regulate my heart rate.
But my pleas were answered with the instantaneous tug of all my cuffs at once. My neck was yanked to the back of the cage
while my wrists and ankles were forced to the sides. I could barely move an inch in the uncomfortable position, the flaring pain in my hip from him fucking me into the table spiking down my leg.
“Darren, please,” I implored again, but the only answer I got was the top of the cage slamming shut over of me.
He then crouched down beside me, his eyes hard with that vengeful intensity I knew so well, devoid of any mercy or sympathy, just like the tone in his voice.
“I wanted you to watch this next part while my cum leaks out of your pussy. Remember how this feels the next time you think about defying me.” Darren then stood back up, straightened his blood-red tie and took out his phone to text something. Ten seconds later, the door to the top of the stairs opened and three of the same guards from earlier descended. “Just so you’re aware,” Darren said as I watched two of the guards pull the same skull face ski masks over their heads while the third went to stand behind the camera. “Every time you look away, Camaro will be the one to take the shock this

time.	So	be	mindful	if	you	don’t	want	your	dog	to	suffer	your
consequences.”
A stunned sob wracked up my throat as more tears slipped down my cheeks, Darren’s cruelty boundless in its ability to torment and destroy.
“You asshole,” I whispered bitterly under my breath as my hands curled into fists. I was rewarded with a quick burst of electricity that jolted through my entire body, the pain sharp and intense.
“Consider that your one and final warning,” he rumbled. “From now on, every curse that leaves your mouth, Camaro will take the shock. One way or another, Jaden, you will learn to control that disrespectful mouth of yours.”
I refused to look at him, my jaw straining as my fingernails bit into the palm of my hands until I was sure I broke the skin. I had warned this man not to threaten my dog, and I vowed right then to make him regret it. If Darren thought he wanted my obedience that bad, then I would fucking bore him to death with it.
“No! Wait! Please!” the woman shouted as the men descended on her.
She fought back as best she could as they ripped her clothes from her body. I watched with blurred vision thanks to the tears in my eyes as they viciously raped her from both ends, one from behind while the other was in her mouth. About three brutal minutes later, they both pulled out long hunting knives that glinted in the dim light.
My stomach ate itself alive as each man took a single turn stabbing her outstretched skinny body at every angle they could reach. I made the mistake of lowering my lids for too long, my body suddenly struck with dread at the sound of Camaro’s sharp yelp and subsequent whine.
The poor woman continued to scream and fight, but it didn’t make one bit of a difference as they drove their blades into her body, covering her with blood as it poured down and soaked into the mattress beneath them.

They continued to fuck and stab her long after she’d gone limp, her lifeless eyes glossed over as she stared off into the empty distance.
Her own husband had orchestrated this, wanted her to die just like this, and wanted to remember her just like this. My body shivered as a desolate coldness seeped into my bones, all the while Darren’s warm cum leaked out of me to drip onto the cold metal floor of the cage.
Was my husband just as cruel as hers? Or was he worse? Would he condemn me to the same fate if he were so inclined? Would he tire of my antics and recycle my body into an immortalized reel of suffering too? Did he actually have a breaking point?
He very nearly killed me just a few weeks ago but stopped at the last second. Maybe it was time I really did change my behavioral strategy.
Whatever power Sid thought I had before was now officially gone. Things had clearly changed thanks to all these wars, and I would have to do what I always did when the occasion called for it—adapt.

DOOMED.



The following morning, I found myself sitting silently in the dining room, attempting to eat my breakfast as quietly as possible while Darren
sipped his coffee and read something on his tablet.
The air was thick with an awkward silence, but if Darren noticed, he certainly didn’t care as he remained focused on his work.
My stomach was still uneasy from the horrors I had witnessed the day before, but I knew Darren wouldn’t accept that as an excuse not to eat. So I settled for fruit and toast, hoping it would be enough.
But the sound of him clearing his throat had me stiffening in my seat, and all my attention immediately focused on his movements as he folded the case over the screen of his tablet and stood.
“When you’re finished, I want you to go see Sid about your hip. You’ve been limping since yesterday, and I want it resolved.”
I wonder why…
I kept my features neutral as my mind went back to the ache still lingering in my hip. I didn’t think I had been limping that bad and had just planned to stretch it out, but if that was what Darren wanted, then I guess I wouldn’t argue.
“Okay,” I responded plainly.
“After that, you’ll spend the day with Ella like we discussed.”

I immediately panicked inside. “Alone? Darren, I have no idea how to care for a toddler.” I mentally cursed myself for arguing, but the panic couldn’t be stopped.
“Carla will assist you.”
That was better than nothing. “Has Katherine woken up yet?” I asked.
Darren paused as he leveled me with a glare of caution. “She woke up last night. She’s fine.”
Relief surged through me at the good news. “I should go see her,” I said, scooting my chair back so I could stand.
“No,” Darren said sharply, causing me to pause in place. “You can see her later, after you’ve done what I’ve asked. Clear?”
I bit my tongue to hide my frustration. “Yes.”
“Good. I’ll see you later.” He took off down the hallway, most likely heading for his office.
“Fuck,” I whispered under my breath. Sighing, I leaned forward and placed my head in my hands, waiting for the anxiety in my stomach to settle.
Today was going to fucking suck.
With my appetite now shot, I got up from my seat, Camaro rising from her bed in the corner to follow me down to Sid’s office in the infirmary. I slowed my pace as I neared Katherine’s room, peaking through the window to see if she really was awake. But from what I could tell, it looked like she was sleeping.
Camaro’s claws clicked against the tile floor as we continued on past the cleaning staff, passing a few nurses who were working on a screaming soldier’s bloody leg. And then I instantly wondered where they were keeping Daniel. Shouldn’t he be in the same room as his wife?
I eventually found Sid in his office, his nose buried in a binder of records at his desk. Knocking against the doorframe, I startled him from his seat.

“Dammit, Jaden!” he accosted me, but all I could do was smirk. “You’re extra jumpy today.”
He huffed his irritation. “Come on, let’s look at that hip,” he said, waving me in.
Stepping inside, I rounded his desk as he went to the sink to wash his hands.
“Lie down, Camaro,” I said, watching my dog find herself a spot on the floor, yawning as she did.
“Okay, let’s take a look,” Sid said as he sat back down in his chair. Lifting the side of my dress for him to see, he furrowed his brows when he noticed the speckled bruises spread over my skin. “Goddamn that man,” he whispered under his breath. “How bad is the pain?”
I shrugged. “A five or six. It just feels a little tight.”
He gently pressed his hand along my skin, feeling the bone and testing the muscle. I winced when the pressure became too much.
“You’re a little inflamed. I’m going to give you a cortisone shot for the pain. It should help bring down the inflammation.”
Opening a drawer, he pulled out a syringe and an alcohol swab. After disinfecting the area, he removed the cap and pressed the needle to my skin. “Slight pinch and a little pressure.”
I gritted my teeth at the “slight pinch” as a weird pressure began to fill in my hip joint. Withdrawing the needle, Sid disposed of it in a medical waste bin, then turned to look at me, his eyes full of scrutiny.
“You look tired. Are you tired?” he asked, raising a brow. I shrugged. My life was exhausting. Of course, I was tired. “Yeah, always.” Duh.
Sid swiveled in his desk chair back to the open drawer and pulled out another syringe.
“I’m gonna give you a B12 shot. Give you some energy and put some pep back into your step.”

I eyed him suspiciously but ultimately resigned over its harmlessness. “Sure, why not,” I said. I didn’t think I was deficient, but I wasn’t going to protest if it gave me back a little more energy.
After injecting the shot into my arm, he disposed of the needle and removed his gloves.
“Okay, you’re all set, Jaden.”
“Thanks. Darren told me Katherine woke up. How is she doing?” I asked.
Sid sighed before he coughed into the elbow of his jacket. “She’s in a lot of pain from the burns, but she’ll be okay. She just needs to rest.”
I nodded. “That’s good. What about Daniel?”
“So far, he’s alive and resting. I expect him to make a full recovery.” “But you don’t know about the potential personality changes?”
Sid shrugged. “Time will tell with that one. It’ll manifest itself one way or another.”
“And Darren is aware that his brother could now be a potential liability to his criminal empire?” I asked.
Sid furrowed his brow, eyeing me with suspicion, but then nodded. “He’s well aware of the risks and challenges that may or may not lie ahead.”
I nodded in acknowledgment. “Well, that’s all good to know. I’d like to be able to visit Katherine when she’s well enough. Will you let me know when I can?”
Sid folded his lips together, tilting his chin before finally answering me. “I’ll try to.”
I gave him a small smile. “Thanks. I’ll see you later. Come on, girl,” I said and headed out of his office, my hip noticeably less tight with each step.
But dread crept into my stomach as I approached Katherine’s room, remembering that I had to entertain her daughter today. Peeking through the

window again, I hoped for some sign of movement, but she seemed to still be in the same position as before. Sighing, I left her to rest and made my way up to the nursery, where I knew Ella was being kept.
Opening the door, I found the room bathed in sunlight, a toddler's soft coos and giggles floating from somewhere off in the corner. My eyes landed on the tiny blonde sitting on the floor, watching Sesame Street and playing with a texturized book.
Behind me, Carla was busy in the small kitchen area, preparing what must be Ella’s lunch. When she turned around, she damn near jumped out of her skin.
“Oh, Mrs. Davis!” she gasped, her hand clutching at her chest. “I didn’t hear you come in.”
I folded my arms and tried not to smirk. That was the second time in one day I’d scared the shit out of someone by being so quiet. Darren must love getting these reactions all the time.
“Sorry,” I said as I moved farther into the room.
Smoothing down her shirt, she regained her composure. “I was just preparing Ella’s lunch. Why don’t you go sit with her while I finish up?” she suggested.
“Sure,” I replied, reluctantly turning around to make my way toward Ella.
Ella stayed focused on her book even though an array of toys surrounded her, her chubby fingers gripping the fuzzy lengths on the cardboard pages. I sat down on the floor next to her and folded my legs, catching Ella’s attention.
“Hi, Ella,” I said sweetly. “Do you remember me?”
Her pretty blue eyes searched my face, like she was trying to recognize me. And then a cute little smile lit up her cheeks followed by a quiet giggle.
“Hi,” she said back shyly.

After a few seconds, she pulled herself up to stand and wobbled over to hand me her book.
“Do you want me to read it?” I asked as I gently took the book from her. She smiled and giggled, plopping down in front of me to open the pages for her to play with.
As I sat there and read, my stubborn ass didn’t want to like this just to spite Darren, but I couldn’t help but enjoy myself. Ella was cute, expressive, and so damn happy for the daughter of a criminal like Daniel. But given who her mother was, I hoped she had more of her genes than his.
I didn’t know what Darren was trying to accomplish by having me do this. He’d just had my birth control replaced, so I knew he wasn’t ready to force a child on me yet.
What was he waiting for? Did he hope this would stir up some baby fever in me and I’d end up begging him for a child? If that was the case, he was more delusional than I thought.
But I decided I would play his game. I could spend as much time with Ella as he wanted me to and it wouldn’t change a damn thing about what I wanted. And I would relish in his failure to inspire for as long as I could.
Because while I knew he wanted me to want a family with him because it would make the whole process easier, my acceptance was ultimately not required.
Given the current status of things, I wondered if I should just accept what was. I had no idea if Jason was alive, I had zero faith in Matt, and Darren had buried another enemy into the dust overnight. It could be years before another attack like that could be orchestrated.
I was sure Matt wasted a lot of resources on Daniel’s home when he failed to actually kill him. He should have been using them to get rid of Darren.
With him out of the way, Daniel would be easier to get to, and Matt wouldn’t have to worry about retaliation. Or maybe he and Jason were

splitting the work to get them both at the same time. Either way, whatever the fuck they were doing, it wasn’t working.
I sighed with frustration. I was going to drive myself insane if I kept going back and forth over it. It was exhausting, and I needed to just take everything one day at a time.
“Okay, everyone,” Carla called as she hustled forward holding a small bowl and spoon in her hands. She stopped in front of the pen and nodded her head at the highchair near the table. “Would you like to feed her?” she asked me.
I blinked up at her. “Uh, sure.”
“Great, just pick her up and put her in the highchair.”
When I looked back down at Ella, she was still playing with the fuzzy cotton on the pages of the book. Reaching out, I picked her up from the floor and placed her on the side of my hip. She squirmed at first, but then giggled as her wide blue eyes focused up at me.
I found myself quickly entranced by the striking coloring of them. Dark blue rimmed her ice-blue irises, the brightness mesmerizing in its contrast.
One thing was certain as I held her. Something took root in the pit of my stomach, and the longer I held her, the faster it grew. And I knew without a shadow of a doubt, if I gave Darren a child, I was fucking doomed. Because I would die before I ever gave that child up to him.
Just like his mother did.

AMBITIONS.









I stared down at the old security feed, watching Jaden interact with Ella in the nursery for like the seventh time today. I loved seeing the shift in her eyes the second she picked her up. Those pretty hazels warmed almost immediately, her features hardening with the determination I had hoped for.
She knew what was expected of her, she knew what was coming, and what would not be stopped.
She’d had plenty of time to come to terms with her future, but I hoped the more comfortable I got her with Ella, the better off she would be.
Hopefully, her anger over the expectation would dissipate faster if she secretly wanted a child. It would be better for her if she did. But I doubted her spiteful stubbornness would allow that to manifest so quickly.
Once she was pregnant and could feel our child growing and moving inside her, whatever anger she was feeling would be replaced with the longing for motherhood. She might hate me for a long time over it, but that hate would disappear into the eyes of our firstborn.
Jaden would cope and adapt just like she always did.
The doors to my office opened without a knock, telling me Scott had something to report on. Dropping a manila folder onto my desk, he plopped

down into the black leather chair behind him.
“Those are the potentials,” he said with a nod toward the folder. “They’re all overly qualified, so personality is probably going to be the next best factor to consider. My advice would be to pick someone she’ll actually want to listen to, someone she’ll respect.”
I scoffed at his joke.
Now, wouldn’t that be a nice change of pace?
Opening the folder, I took the profiles of Jaden’s new potential bodyguards Scott had gathered and spread them out across my desk. Each one had a photo attached to it so I knew what kind of build they would be using to protect my most precious possession. Studying the profiles, an interesting one caught my attention.
“A woman, huh?” I commented as I glanced up at Scott. He nodded as I opened the profile.
“She’s six foot three and built like a tank. A stone-cold Russian like her might be a good change of pace for Jaden. She certainly wouldn’t be barred from the lady’s restroom like Clive and Owen had been.”
“True,” I replied as I flipped through the pages, reading all her credentials.
“I’ve also worked with her in the past. I’d trust her with even my life.”
I glanced back up at Scott to see that he was serious. But as it turned out, she did have an impressive background. Former SVR, expert marksman, ballistic specialist, speaks five languages, and has guarded over a dozen foreign nationals. She even spent some time with the yakuza a few years back. But given her appearance, she would definitely draw some attention.
“Why did she leave the SVR?”
“Sexism,” Scott answered. “Apparently, her looks just didn’t suit for the roles they wanted women like her to play.”

I chucked a laugh, entirely unsurprised. “It’s Russian intelligence, color me shocked. She looks like the damn female boogeyman,” I commented.
Her pale yet blotchy complexion was marred by multiple scars, none of which could be hidden behind a curtain of hair since hers stopped just above her brow. Intriguingly, the faded buzzed-cut sides gave visibility to the outline of a red-and-black Japanese dragon tattoo etched along the side of her skull.
Likely in her late thirties, her ice-blue eyes were sharp as steel, a familiar dark gaze hardened by years of field experience. And Scott was right, she was built like a tank, with an impressive physique I knew Jaden would immediately envy. Maybe she would be a good match for her after all.
“She seems a little eccentric, but I’ll consider it,” I said as I set the profile aside. Catching Scott’s eyes, he looked like he had more to say. I raised a brow in expectation.
“Daniel is still asking for you,” he said, reminding me for the second time.
“He shouldn’t be. He needs to be resting,” I replied as I glanced through another profile.
“He says he can’t rest until he talks to you.”
I rolled my eyes before bringing them up to meet Scott’s gaze. “He just wants to pester me for shit he shouldn’t be thinking about. He needs to relax.”
“You know he won’t until you put his mind at ease. And it’s already been a week.”
“For fuck’s sake,” I cursed under my breath, pinching the bridge of my nose. “Fine. I’ll go see him this afternoon. Where are we with the investigation?”
Scott stared at me before sighing in apparent frustration and shook his head. “I have no idea how Matt knew we would be there. The only thing I

can think of is he found some way to track us.”
I frowned at the logic. “But he already knew we were in Chicago. Why wait to have us attacked later when he could have done it then?”
Scott shrugged. “Maybe he didn’t have the time or the manpower then to mobilize an attack. Maybe the location was wrong? Who knows? Could be a million things.”
I cocked a brow. “He was the one who lured me to Chicago in the first place. It’s unlike him to fumble an opportunity.”
“Maybe something fell through, and he couldn’t act when he wanted to. Or maybe he had no plans to attack you in Chicago at all. Maybe he just wanted you out of California so he could take advantage of your absence and use it to attack Daniel.”
I thought about that
“Probably. But that doesn’t explain how he knew where we were going,” I added, sitting back against my chair. “He should have assumed I would just return home.”
Scott shook his head. “Someone had to have been tracking us.”
I paused to consider that. It was likely, and it wouldn’t be the first time someone followed me. But it was quite the stretch to follow me that closely undetected.
“There’s a missing link somewhere, and we need to find it.”
Scott nodded in silence, his eyes drifting off in thought while mine shifted back to the computer screen.
Jaden was now spoon-feeding something orange to Ella. I exhaled a deep, satisfying breath, relaxing my body as I watched her.
The longer I stared, the more I noticed a warm sense of optimism and hope blooming in my chest, overpowering my incessant drive for war and carnage. And soon, a decision quickly solidified itself in my mind over a desire that just couldn’t be beat anymore.

I wanted to finally start my family with Jaden. But in order to do that, I needed to destroy someone else’s.
“We need to arrange a hit on Matt and all of his immediate family members. I don’t care who kills them or how, I just want them all dead.”
Scott was quiet for a moment before he took out his phone. “How much?”
“Five hundred thousand each, and one million for Matt with a two-year exclusive contract.”
He nodded as he stood to make the call. Keeping my focus on Jaden, I realized I was already bored with this war with Matt. I just wanted him fucking dead so I could be done with his petty bullshit and move on. He’d destroyed one of my homes, one of my brother’s homes, marred his family, and nearly took his life.
Matt had caused enough hell to officially become a goddamn plague, so I would utilize every resource I had to finally bring it all to an end. And if that meant recruiting some blood-thirsty mercs, then so be it.
Their assistance would even give me the time I needed to flush out this new shadow enemy of mine before they became any more of a problem than they already were. I was not about to supplement one war for another when I finally found them out. I wanted that issue done quick, clean, and contained.
When I was finished looking through the remaining profiles for Jaden’s new bodyguard, I decided I was putting Daniel off long enough. Glancing back up at the computer screen, my chest warmed as I watched Jaden play with Ella on the floor, her gorgeous face lighting up with the same brilliant smile she would eventually show our own child.
Starting tomorrow, my main focus would center on nothing else other than making that a reality within the next nine months. But first, I needed to get her obedience back on track.

Rising from my seat, I sighed as I made my way down to the infirmary, already irritated by the conversation I would have to endure with my brother.
With his brain injury, we had no idea what to expect, and I really didn’t feel like testing the waters right now, given his “fragile” state.
Bypassing Katherine’s room, I rounded the hallway into our little intensive care unit, finding Daniel sitting up in his bed. He was typing something out on his phone when he looked up and noticed my entrance.
“About fucking time, Darren,” he muttered.
“Shut up. You should be resting,” I clipped as I sat down in the chair beside his bed. He had a white bandage wrapped around his head where the bullet had entered his skull, grazing about a centimeter across his frontal lobe, and then exiting his temple.
“Fuck that. I’ll rest after I finally kill that motherfucker,” Daniel retorted, an irritated edge to his voice. The asshole was lucky to be alive. Again. It was now the second time Matt had almost succeeded in killing him.
“Yeah well, someone else might beat you to it before you get the chance,” I told him.
His brows snapped together. “What the hell are you talking about?”
I cracked my neck, ready for the explosion. “I just put out a four- million-dollar hit on him twenty minutes ago. One million for his immediates.”
His scratched and bruised-up face suddenly turned even redder. “You what?!” he nearly roared.
I tried not to roll my eyes. “Calm down before you give yourself a brain aneurysm,” I warned.
He immediately scoffed. “Since when the fuck do you commission open contracts on people? We always handle our problems ourselves.”

“Since this morning when I decided I had better things to do than waste another second on that spineless little fuck. I want this shit done, Dan.”
He looked like I had slapped him. “Better things to do? You have better things to do than avenge your only remaining brother for the attack on his life, home, and family? Are you fucking serious?”
“Don’t be so fucking dramatic, Daniel. It’s not like I’m calling anything off, I’m actually ramping it up. You’re the one who started this war, if you want to finish it your way, no one is stopping you.”
The scowl on Daniel’s face reflected that of a man unhinged. “It still wasn’t your decision to make, Darren,” he seethed.
I tilted my chin in his direction, leveling him with a glare I typically reserved for lesser men.
“Every decision is mine to make,” I reminded him. “Do you understand me? This is not a fucking democracy, Daniel.”
“And isn’t that the whole fucking problem,” he snapped, the scowl on his face tightening. “Who made the decision to leave for Chicago when I specifically told you not to go? And look what fucking happened! If you’d have been here, we might have actually been able to end Matt when he attacked me, but no! You walked right into the trap I warned you about.”
I tried to suppress the growl scratching up my throat, my hands itching to strangle him. “What trap? The trap that led to Miguel’s demise? That one? Or are you just pissed because you nearly had Matt in your grasp, and not only did you fail to end him but you also lost your home in the process, and a pretty piece of your brain. Am I getting warm, Daniel?”
“Fuck you, Darren! We were outnumbered and yeah, I took a bullet to the head!”
“And you lived! Stop whining because big brother wasn’t there to hold your fucking hand,” I snarled. “You and Matt both failed. Again. And he cost himself a shit ton of resources in that attack. And what did you lose? A house. Big deal. I lost one too, and I’m not crying about it.”

“I almost died, Darren!” he shouted back.
“We almost die nearly every damn day, Daniel. It comes with the job, yet here we still stand. You should be reveling in your obvious invincibility since no one can seem to kill your ass despite the number of times they’ve tried.”
He scoffed and threw his hands up in the air.
“That’s not the point,” he retorted bitterly. “I told you not to leave, and you left anyway. Then we were both attacked. And now you’re making us look even weaker by letting someone else do our dirty work! It makes us look like we can’t handle our own shit, and we can’t afford to look like that right now!”
I pinched the bridge of my nose and sighed, fighting off the growing tension in my temples and the raging desire to break my brother’s jaw just so I could have it wired shut.
“See, this is why I didn’t want to come down here,” I barked. “You’re way too hot-headed to be thinking clearly right now. No one is backing down. You just need to sit back and heal.”
“I don’t need to do shit!” he bellowed, his face growing redder. “What you need to do is find your fucking balls and—” I had him by the throat before he could even finish that sentence, pinning him hard into the pillows behind his head. His eyes widened in shock while his hand gripped my wrist, but he was far too weak to push me off.
“Be very careful, little brother,” I warned, my words slow enough for him to understand. “We may be family, but that doesn’t mean my tolerance for disrespect is any different. If you weren’t recovering from a traumatic brain injury right now, you’d already be picking your teeth up from the fucking floor.” Releasing his throat with a shove, I stepped off and stood a few feet away from his bed, running my hands through my hair. “You haven’t even asked me about your wife or daughter. Is revenge really the only thing you care about?”

Daniel rubbed at his throat, scowling at me with eyes that wanted to set me on fire. “That man has caused us enough trouble,” he replied through clenched teeth. “He should have been dead a long time ago.”
“I agree, he should have,” I replied bitterly. “But that’s not how reality works, Daniel. These things do not end overnight. You know this. Matt’s not some small-time drug lord in a turf war whose resources are limited to one city,” I continued, my eyes snapping to his. “You need to be patient. He won’t survive much longer, not with a price on his head.”
He rolled his eyes and groaned. “You don’t get it, Darren. I want to be the one to kill him! His death belongs to me! Not some fucking scummy hitman from Romania.”
I shook my head, folding my arms across my chest, decidedly done with this conversation. “I’m not stopping you from killing him, Dan. If you’re so hell-bent, then by all means, have at it, but I am done wasting my personal time chasing that fuck around when I have other pursuits that also need my attention. I want this done and over with so we can all move the fuck on. If that means I utilize an additional resource I’ve always had access to, then so be it.”
He scoffed again and shook his head, his eyes maintaining a look of arrogance I wanted to smack right off his face. “If it’s really that important to you, Dan, I’ll let you skull-fuck his corpse until your heart’s content. Now get some fucking rest before I knock you the fuck out myself.”
With that, I turned around and walked out of the room, irritated that he was capable of running his mouth for so long.
Turning the corner, I stormed into Sid’s office, nearly knocking the old man out of his chair from my abrupt entrance.
“For a man who just took a bullet to the head, he has way too much energy to be that emotional. Up his meds,” I ordered.
Sid released an exasperated breath as he finally relaxed in his chair a bit, resting his hands on his desk. “We talked about this, Darren. We knew

your brother’s cognitive state was going to be delicate. His behavior may become erratic at the most random of times. This will require some patience.”
My patience with my brother was running very thin lately.
“That’s fine when he’s fully healed and I can beat the shit out of him again. But until then, he needs to stay in a less wrathful state of mind before he does something stupid.”
Sid nodded before quickly turning away to cough into his sleeve. “I’ll.”
Cough. “Take care.” Cough, cough. “Of it.” Cough, cough, cough.
“You do that,” I said over his coughing fit, turning around to head back up to my office. I had several positions that needed immediate replacements, and now I would have to add a private physician to the list too.
As I stepped out of the elevator, my phone rang, showing Scott on the other line.
“What?” I answered as I moved back to my office.
“We’ve got a big fucking problem. Someone just annihilated the
Lobos.”
I stopped in my tracks, a blaze of fury mixed with disbelief swarming through my bloodstream.
“What?” I had to have misheard him.
“Someone just sent us a video of their entire village completely up in flames. Dead bodies were riddled with bullet holes, and the fields were decimated. They razed the entire place to the ground,” Scott explained.
I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, trying to calm the growing rage so I could think rationally.
Mother. Fucker.
“Did they leave a calling card?” I asked. “Any indication as to who or why?” Even though I already had a damn good idea.

“Not yet. I’m sending a team down there to investigate while I get to work on who sent the video to us.”
I shook my head as I tried to contain my rage. “This had to be Matt. No one else would have a reason to attack the Lobos and destroy the crop. This was strictly retaliatory. Otherwise, they would have kept the fields for themselves.”
“I’m willing to bet the same,” Scott agreed. “From the looks of it, they were very thorough. Nothing was spared. It had to have been a sophisticated operation.”
My thoughts returned to my conversation with the general and his threats about my global operations. If anyone had the reason, the means, and the fucking ego, it would be him. No doubt Matt finally called in a fucking favor.
“When you confirm it was General Rainer, let me know.” I hung up the phone and practically stormed down the hallway back to my office, ready to pull out every single speck of damning evidence I had to finally bury that old motherfucker once and for all.

SLOANE.









Two weeks had gone by, two whole-ass weeks, and Darren still wouldn’t let me see Katherine. Though I could always see Ella any time I wanted.
He was testing me, and I knew that. My ability to act like the good and obedient little housewife he suddenly desired was on trial every second of every day. And I’d been nothing but a perfect fucking angel just to spite him.
I understood the shift, and it was my own damn fault. But goddamn, even I was bored with our interactions, annoyed with myself, and hating the sweet and innocent personality I had adopted as I pretended everything was fine.
Every day was a “yes, Darren” day, and it made things so dull when I couldn’t antagonize him just to take a swing at his face anymore. But that certainly didn’t stop Darren from taking a swing at me.
Catching on to my malicious compliance, he slapped me across the face, telling me to stop being annoying even though I was just doing what he said he wanted. It was the only indication I had received that told me I had met my mark. So I switched my personality from sweet and annoying to silent and boring.

After that, he acted like nothing was amiss, and I guess, technically, it wasn’t. He remained surprisingly less antagonizing, actually avoiding intentionally taunting me so I wouldn’t be tempted to argue with him.
There was no more playfulness to him, it was all business now. He laid out his orders for the day as if he were announcing the weather and expected full compliance without issue. And that was exactly what I gave him—boring, robotic compliance.
I wanted to bait him so badly, to remind him when he was being stupid and pig-headed. My nature to raise hell was a constant urge I had to beat back like a rabid dog, but he just wasn’t worth testing anymore, not with his threat of harming others hanging over my head.
In fact, I made sure to say as little as I possibly could to him, speaking only when prompted.
But if I was being honest, there wasn’t much time for conversation when he preferred to spend it fucking me as often as he could in every which way possible.
What was worse, he’d removed all of my thongs and replaced them with these ridiculous special G-strings made of nothing but a thin waistband and a string of pearl beads down the center.
I knew immediately what they were for, but I just didn’t understand why the sudden change. But when Darren noticed me frowning in the mirror, he informed me I was expected to wear them all day, every day, with no exceptions.
I could feel the annoyance heating my face, but instead of lashing out, I decided to test my new strict boundaries by asking a seemingly innocent question.
But the cold dark fury I received in response had me retreating a few steps back to avoid being swallowed up by his approaching towering frame. I didn’t push it any further by objecting to his answer that I was, in fact, still expected to wear them even when I was training or working out.

I had to suppress the urge to ask why, but it would be a fruitless pursuit that wasn’t worth testing the consequences for. So I gave Darren the submissive little nod he wanted and finally released the breath I had been holding when he left the room.
Begrudgingly, I slipped them on, dreading the frustration I knew they were going to cause me as the string of pearls slid between my legs to press gently against my clit. With even the slightest of movements, the pearls would massage all the right places, keeping me in a constant state of soaking-wet need.
I already had enough reasons to kill Darren, but this was now in the top five. The never-ending sexual frustration left me in an irritated mood, the perpetual mess between my legs requiring more discretion than I liked in order to avoid leaving wet stains anywhere I sat. There was barely any relief throughout the day.
Even after Darren fucked me, he still expected me to keep them on after. At least he hadn’t forbidden me from orgasming on my own if I needed it. He told me I could make myself come as often as I wanted, but the pearls would remain in place.
From then on, every time Darren saw me, even if it was just a passing glance in the hallway, I’d find myself bent over something nearby. He was suddenly a fucking machine, and I didn’t understand why he was so hell- bent on making sure I couldn’t walk straight by the end of every day.
If I wasn’t so sexually frustrated and horny all the time, I would have avoided him like the plague just to give my poor pussy a damn break.
One day, I had tried to cheat for a few hours by pushing the pearls between the crease of my leg, just for a few moments of relief. When I realized Darren was looking for me, I quickly slipped them back into place, but there wasn’t enough time for the desired effects to liquefy before he found me.

When he saw that I wasn’t soaking like he expected, he slammed into me dry as punishment. Thankfully, it only took a couple of strokes for my body to get with the program, but those first thirty seconds were brutal. It seemed those pearls served an important purpose I finally understood—to protect me from Darren’s new unhinged impatience.
Toward the end of that second week, he called me into his office, making my legs immediately tremble and my stomach clench. He had already fucked me four times today, and it was barely 3:00 p.m.
With Camaro at my side, I reluctantly made my way down the hall to find the doors wide open and Darren sitting at his desk. I approached tentatively, hoping he had another objective on his mind while my clit, still swollen from the pearls, had different hopes.
“Come here, Jaden,” he ordered, his fingers waving me closer, a sultry look on his face.
I physically stumbled to a stop. “Darren, please, I swear to God, if you fuck me one more time today, my vagina is going to shrivel up and die.”
Fuck, I hope that wasn’t an overstep.
My stomach flipped at the curse, but I noticed Darren didn’t seem to punish me if I was referring to the act rather than using the word for verbal decoration.
A dark smirk formed its way into the corner of his mouth. “Fine. I have someone I want you to meet anyway.”
I breathed a sigh of relief, my shoulders sagging, only to briefly pause and cocked a brow. “Who?” I asked.
“Your new bodyguard.”
I stilled for a moment, my nerves catching up with his words. Slow, heavy footsteps thumped against the hardwood of the floor, the sound bringing my attention to the person I hadn’t realized was standing behind me in the corner of the room the entire time.

Turning around, I widened my eyes as I watched my new bodyguard approach me, surprised at Darren’s choice. Standing before me was a very tall, well-built Amazon of a woman.
She had the typical haircut of a man—longer at the top with a high fade at the sides. But the fresh buzz cut revealed a sweet ass black and red oriental-looking dragon that was tattooed into the side of her skull.
The tattoo was so fucking cool that it nearly distracted me from all the other scars spread across her hardened, but still surprisingly, pretty face. She had to be at least six feet two, maybe six feet three, and built like a fucking tank. I couldn’t stop staring at her. I was in complete awe.
“Wow,” I whispered, just gawking at her like a dumbstruck idiot. My clit suddenly pulsed as it brushed against the pearls.
Am I in love?
“Jaden.”
I blinked. “Huh?”
Darren’s gaze hardened with perplexed annoyance. “This is Sloane.
She’s your newest Camaro,” he informed me.
Turning my wide stare back to the incredible Amazon, I gave her a pitiful little wave. “Hi,” I breathed, sounding like a dazed child.
Her eyes warmed as the corner of her lips lifted. “Hello, Mrs. Davis. It is nice to finally meet you,” she said politely, her accent noticeably Russian. It wasn’t heavy, but it was definitely obvious.
Camaro walked closer to Sloane, her head tilting left and right as her nose sniffed the air around her. She must have been satisfied because she turned her nose down and moved back to stand beside me with a yawn.
“Only one?” I asked Darren, surprised he didn’t replace both Clive and
Owen.
“For now,” he answered seriously. “That will change by a lot if or when I decide you can leave the house again.” I nodded solemnly, hating the way he phrased that. But he continued, tilting his head with an odd sense of

pride at the giant of a woman behind me. “Sloane surpassed all the trials far better than any of the other candidates. She will make an excellent addition to your security team.”
I raised my brow. “She outperformed the men? Imagine that,” I commented as I turned my gaze back to Sloane, catching the flash of humor in her eyes.
It was a subtle taunt, but I couldn’t help but point it out. Even Darren had to admit that women could serve as more than just a profitable wet pocket for men to use.
“You know I prefer intelligence to brawn any day,” he responded darkly.
I nodded in acknowledgment and pursed my lips for a moment. Muscle wasn’t everything in this world.
“Is she aware of what happened to my last bodyguards?”
Darren’s gaze narrowed. “She’s well aware of their failures, yes,” he replied, his voice laced with warning.
I tried not to glare back at the insult, instead turning my gaze back to Sloane to find her standing like a proud soldier, like she was ready to lay down everything on the line.
But given the risks, why would anyone even want the job in the first place? If the ultimate end was to die for me, what benefit was there for them? What was Darren using to secure the role? Were these people just suicidal or something?
“What made you want the job?” I asked Sloane directly.
She didn’t even look at Darren before answering. “It’s a great honor to protect you from harm,” she answered confidently. “For both me and my family.”
I furrowed my brow in confusion. “A great honor? Your life expectancy just dropped to zero for someone you don’t even know. Your termination ends in death.”

“That’s enough, Jaden. This is an introduction, not a fucking interview,” Darren scolded, clearly not liking my line of questioning.
Sloane nodded, unbothered by the exchange. “Yes, an honor. And my family will be rewarded should my sacrifice be required.”
Well, someone had a damn good life insurance policy.
My gaze returned to Darren, catching the warning in his eye that made my stomach clench. He’d found another sucker willing to die for me, and I needed not to fuck it up.
“Is there anything else, then?” I asked him, hoping to be dismissed.
The look he gave me was not one of approval. “No. You both can go.
I’ll see you at dinner.”
I nodded. “Okay, then,” I said gently, and walked out of his office with Camaro at my side and Sloane following close.
I had a new problem to figure out now. Trying to discern what kind of trouble Sloane would be for me. Was she the nosy type?
She seemed to be too straitlaced for that. She acted like more of a soldier compared to Clive and Owen. And the fact that she was soloing this job without a partner told me Darren must have really been impressed with her.
I was suddenly interested in what made her that impressive.
Making my way into my private gym, Sloane followed me in, and I stopped at my octagon.
“I don’t have a training partner today. Would you mind filling in for me?” I asked her.
“Of course,” she said with a professional nod. “What would you like to start with?”
“I thought maybe a little light sparring?”
She dipped her chin at me. “I will wait for you to change then,” she commented, noting I still wore my regular clothes.

“Oh, sometimes I like to practice in regular clothes since I’m rarely attacked in my workout clothes,” I answered with a wink, then pointed at the trunk against the far wall. “But I do have pairs of shorts that I usually slip on to avoid showing off my ass.”
I gave her a tight smile before I headed to the trunk and discreetly slipped on the shorts. My bare ass wouldn’t be the only thing exposed since the stupid string of pearls concealed absolutely nothing.
Sloane gave me a sly grin as she followed me. “You’ve been through multiple attacks, yes?” she asked as she removed her suit jacket and tie.
“More than I’d like. What about you? What kind of action have you been through?”
“I have been on many rescue missions for extraction in dangerous cities around the world. I have also been the head of many security details for multiple politicians, celebrities, and infamous drug lords and their families for several years. I’ve had my fair share of action.”
“Uh-huh,” I said, listening intently as I began to wrap my hand, making sure I left my rings on this time. “So what’s the real reason you want to give all that up just to babysit me full-time?”
Her lips curled as she began to roll up her sleeves. “I’d heard about you before. The rumors made you sound respectable and intriguing. When Scott reached out about possible recruitment, I decided it was a worthy opportunity.” She began to roll up her other sleeve and continued her explanation. “Most wives or daughters of my previous clients are spoiled until they’ve become rotten inside. Your background did not give me that impression.”
I raised my gaze to her. “No?”
What the hell gave her that impression?
“No,” she affirmed as she began to wrap her hands. “You seemed like a person worth protecting, deserving of such selfless devotion.”

I paused at her answer, surprised she felt the way she did without ever knowing or meeting me.
“You got all that just from pieces of paper?”
She stepped closer to me, her chin dipping low as she looked down at me. “No, I’ve actually been watching you for the past week. And your interactions confirmed my initial perception.”
I felt my lips folding into a tight line, wondering if I should tell her the truth about my recent personality switch.
“Interactions with who?” I asked tentatively. Her brows knitted together. “Does it matter?”
“More than you could imagine.” If she had been basing her perceptions on my interactions with Darren, which were now entirely different from how they were almost a month ago, then she really had no clue who I was. Would she change her mind if she did? And then I suddenly paused, wondering why the hell I was seeking a stranger’s approval. “You know what? Never mind. Let’s just go to work.”
Sloane nodded in agreement. “Would you like to do drills first or get straight to the sparring?”
“We can spar,” I said, fastening my last glove in place. “Very good.”
Leaving our shoes on the floor, we stepped into the cage. Sloane closed the gate behind us to make sure Camaro didn’t interfere. She was used to watching me train, but this was a new person, and I didn’t want to take any chances.
Taking our spots on the mat, I stretched out my arms and legs, bouncing a little on my bare feet, trying not to wince as the pearls grazed between my slit.
“Ready?” Sloane asked.
I nodded. “Ready.”

Moving in on each other, we closed the gap between us and immediately started exchanging blows. She dodged most of my strikes, taking only a few to the face and body, and carefully maneuvering around my kicks. I had to admit the woman was fast.
“What kind of a name is Sloane?” I asked as I ducked under one of her roundhouse kicks. “Doesn’t sound very Russian to me.”
She chuckled as we danced around each other. “That is because it is not my birth name,” she answered as she veered to the right of my elbow strike.
“Why don’t you go by your birth name?” I asked.
Her lips curled as she gave me a knowing look. “That’s a story for another day,” she replied as she released a series of strikes I barely managed to dodge. Clearly, someone didn’t want to divulge too much about themselves. “I’ve studied your fighting pattern,” she said, her breathing remaining steady and even. “You have an interesting fighting style.”
I dodged her strike to my nose, but not the one to my kidney, causing me to wince as I sidestepped her. “How so?” I asked between breaths, trying to ignore those goddam pearls between my legs.
“You have a small frame. Yet you’re able to throw your weight around with much success. It’s fascinating to watch.”
I just barely dodged her kick to my head, moving to my knees to strike her in the gut. She took the hit and then lightly punched me on the side of my head. From my vantage point, I quickly turned to jump on her back and wrap one arm around her neck. “I guess I had to create my own adaptive style,” I said before dropping my weight to hang from her neck.
It only took Sloane a few seconds to shake me. She whipped me around, then slammed me on the floor. But I managed to keep my legs tucked and kicked her with both feet as she tried to regain her balance.
“Have you ever fought Darren?” I asked, standing from a kip-up.
She dipped her chin with a slight nod. “Three times during the trials last week,” she answered, bringing her leg up for a hook kick. “He is the best

I’ve ever fought.”
I almost rolled my eyes. Of course, he was.
Dodging her kick, I moved in with a side kick, landing it square into her gut. But she didn’t even react. She just took the hit and then attempted to punch me right in the head. But she switched her tactic and grabbed my arm to flip me over her shoulder, causing me to land on my bad hip.
Ah fuck!
I groaned through gritted teeth, pain flaring up in my joint that started to spread throughout my pelvis and down my leg. When Camaro saw I wasn’t getting back up, she stood on her hind legs against the cage and started to bark. Sloane immediately froze in place.
“You are hurt,” she declared, releasing her hold on me.
“No, no,” I replied quickly, sitting up and waving her off. “It’s from a previous injury. I’m fine. It just flares up sometimes.”
“From your gunshot wound?”
I looked up at her to find concern in her eyes. “He told you about that, huh?”
She frowned at my question. “When I passed the trials and accepted the position, I was given an extensive report on your characteristics, personality, mental state, and various medical records. I studied well.”
Now that was a report I’d love to get my hands on.
“I’m sure it was an interesting read,” I commented, pushing myself up to a stand and placing more weight on my other hip.
She nodded. “I think we are done for the day. Do you need anything for your hip?”
I released a slow, deep breath, the pain aching all the way down my leg. “Just a large bucket of ice delivered to my bathroom,” I said as I pulled my gloves and wraps off.
“Of course.” She headed for the door, leaving me alone with Camaro.

I tried to hide my limp as I stepped out of the cage to put my gloves and wraps away, but Camaro immediately ran to my side to sniff and whine at me.
“Think she’s gonna be a problem, big girl?”
Camaro pressed her nose into my leg, her tongue hanging out of her mouth as she continued to whine at me.
“Yeah, I’ll have to figure out what to do about this one.”

WARNINGS.



Sloane was a difficult character to decipher. She was quiet for the most part, not one for jokes or sarcasm, but she would converse when coaxed
by me.
She was the straight shooting, robotic ice giant that I couldn’t quite crack. Sloane was respectful, polite, and even helpful at times, only too happy to provide me with whatever I needed.
Carla actually seemed annoyed by Sloane’s swift and innovative sufficiency, like she was putting her out of business or something. But when the two of them teamed up with their efforts, I found myself at complete odds.
Clive and Owen had never been this coordinated, this diligent in their duties. Clive and Owen acted like annoyingly protective older brothers in comparison to Sloane.
Even so, I still kind of missed those fuckheads.
It was interesting being surrounded by more women, an entire team of females tasked with my well-being. My personal, emotional, and security needs were all handled with a kind of sisterhood I had trouble adjusting to at first, irrationally afraid Darren might find some way to disapprove and take it all back.

But once I got used to it, it was cool for the first two weeks, but after a while, the constant reassurance I had to give them that I was fine and didn’t need anything was getting old. It was also hard to find time to be alone.
When I wasn’t with Sloane and Carla, I was getting fucked by Darren several times a day. I didn’t understand where he got the energy, but he was stealing all of mine until I was too depleted to even move. But on a day I was feeling particularly courageous, I finally asked Darren to let me see Katherine. The worst he could say was no. Again.
“Darren,” I said gently, adjusting my skirt as I watched him refasten his

tie.

“What.”
I folded my lips into a thin line, suddenly unsure of myself due to his

clipped tone. Softening my gaze, I released a slow breath. “Can I please see Katherine today?”
His eyes lifted to mine, hitting me with that deep intensity that always seemed to swallow me whole. Instead of answering me, he turned around to grab his suit jacket, slipping it over his shoulders and buttoning it at his waist. And then he finally glanced back up at me.
“I’ll talk to Daniel,” he said, and then walked out of the room.
My eyes stayed stuck on the door Darren had just shut behind him, his cum still leaking out of me and soaking into the sheets. I found myself stuck to the bed, puzzling over how things had changed since we got back to the estate.
My mind replayed much of our interactions, quickly recognizing his clear intent to reduce me to nothing more than the obedient fuck-doll I’d been in the basement.
Darren barely spoke to me, and any words he did speak were short and clipped. He spent more time fucking me than he ever had before, and ignored me almost entirely when he wasn’t. Was he overcompensating our

time because he wouldn’t let me fight him anymore? Was my pussy the only thing left that actually entertained him now?
No. I shook my head at the thought. We’d already been through his era once before, and he came to hate it. This was just another phase, and it wouldn’t last forever.
Darren wanted me because I fought him, because I was the reoccurring challenge he never seemed to tire of, and I was sure he would miss the conflict. I just didn’t know how long it would be before he finally broke, but I had a strong feeling it had everything to do with Matt.
Once Darren finally eliminated him, I was sure he would lighten up again. But with Matt gone, my chances of escape diminished even more. And I really didn’t want to think about that right now.
With a sigh, I stood from the bed, cleaned myself up, and swapped the pearls with a fresh pair that wasn’t sticky with Darren’s cum. After changing into some workout clothes, I stepped through the bedroom door, pausing as I came face-to-face with Sloane standing in the hallway with Camaro. I glanced down the hallway, wondering if she had seen Darren pass by.
“Did Darren say anything to you when you passed him?”
Sloane’s brows furrowed with a confused suspicion. “He did not,” she answered as she stared down at me. “Did you expect him to?”
I shrugged and then shook my head. “I guess not.” Would she even tell me if he did?
“Come,” she said, gesturing to the stairs. “Let us go outside. It is a beautiful day.”


I TOSSED the Frisbee to Sloane, chuckling softly as I watched Camaro dart off for it. I didn’t often get to play keep-away from her since it was damn

near impossible to get Clive or Owen to participate. But Sloane seemed happy to oblige.
A couple of times Camaro had managed to wrangle it before we could snatch it from her, but she was still excited to chase it all the same.
Standing in the shade of the trees, Sloane tossed the Frisbee again across the lawn, but the wind suddenly picked up and swung it a few feet to my right. When it hit the ground, I quickly reached down to grab it before Camaro could.
But she was faster than I had anticipated. We both went for the Frisbee at the same time, but instead of the Frisbee, her jaw clenched right over my left hand instead.
A quick sharp pain struck through my hand, a yelp slipping from my mouth as I drew my hand back. Camaro immediately whined and cried at realizing she had accidentally bitten me, her entire body shaking back and forth as she moved.
“Jaden, are you okay?” Sloane called as she came running from across the lawn.
Pulling my hand from my chest, I saw a few red puncture marks below my knuckles and near my thumb, blood coating my skin as it seeped from the wounds.
“Shit,” I whispered to myself.
“Let me see that,” Sloane demanded as she gently took my hand.
“It was an accident. She didn’t mean to bite me. I reached for the Frisbee at the same time she did,” I tried to explain.
Sloane nodded. “Okay. We should get you over to Sid.”
“Oh, come on. It’s not that serious. I can clean this up myself.”
“Jaden, you were bitten by a dog. On your hand, no less. Sid needs to take care of this.”
I sighed as the anxiety filtered through me. If Darren found out about this, I was afraid of what he would do about Camaro. She was already on

thin ice as it was.
Begrudgingly, I followed Sloane down to the infirmary with Camaro trailing behind me.
“It’s okay, Camaro,” I cooed, trying to calm her down. But inside, I was anything but calm. Darren was going to be furious, and I didn’t know how I was going to get him to forgive her.
Sid cleaned up my hand as carefully as possible, and examined the punctures.
“Well, the good news is that it doesn’t look like you need any stitches. The bites aren’t that deep,” he confirmed. “But I’m going to give you some antibiotics, just in case.”
I breathed a small sigh of relief, but Sloane didn’t look any happier. No doubt Darren would somehow find a way to blame her as well.
When Sid was done treating and bandaging my hand, I looked down at my dog and the dark feeling of dread crept over me. I didn’t want Darren to find out, but I was sure Sloane would have to report what happened to him anyway.
“Is there any way I can convince you to let me tell Darren what happened?” I asked her.
She folded her lips and then gently shook her head. I groaned aloud. I knew it was a long shot.
“Fuck.”
“Why don’t we go see Katherine now and think about this later,” she offered. “I was just informed that you may join her for lunch.”
Fucking finally!
Suddenly rejuvenated, I hopped down from Sid’s medical table and patted Camaro behind the ears.
“Okay, let’s go.”
I eagerly kept up at Sloane’s side, trying to hide my impatience as I followed her to Katherine, my bite now long forgotten. I had no idea where

they were keeping her. I hadn’t seen her once since she and Daniel had been transferred back to one of the guest bedrooms. It seemed she was bound to her bed just like I had been.
It turned out that her room had been on the other side of the mansion, far from where I usually was. A guard stood outside the room, nodding at Sloane as he opened the door for us to enter.
Walking into the suite, my eyes scanned every inch of the elaborate room, searching for the source of the laughter I was hearing. Rounding the corner, I found Katherine sitting on the couch with Ella, reading her a book while the news played in the background.
Hearing our entrance, Katherine turned her head in our direction, her soft features lighting up as her sad eyes met mine.
“Jaden,” she breathed, a smile curving her lips. She stood as I approached her, both of our arms reaching out as we embraced, but the second we did, I felt her flinch.
“Oh my God, I’m so sorry,” I blurted, immediately pulling away. “I should have known better.” Her burns had to still be healing, and I was stupid enough to hug her.
“No, it’s okay,” she said, waving me off as she tucked her honey blond hair behind her ear. “I’m fine, really.” But the scars along the side of her face spoke a different story. While the majority of it seemed to be healing, they still looked angry and red. And painful. But then she looked down at my bandaged hand. “Oh, no, what happened?”
“Oh, it’s nothing. How’s the healing been?” I asked as we sat down on the couch, Sloane standing just behind us. Camaro whined as she pressed her nose into Katherine’s knees, coaxing some ear scratching and gentle petting.
“It’s been slow, but I’m coping,” she stated softly. “As long as I keep the burns covered, Ella doesn’t seem to notice.”
“And what about Daniel?” I dared to ask.

Katherine paused for a moment as she continued to fluff Camaro’s ears. “He avoids looking at me.”
I sighed quietly in disappointment. “I’m sorry, Katherine. Your cheek really doesn’t look that bad. I’m sure once it’s finally healed, he’ll lighten up.”
She slowly shook her head. “Not this time,” she whispered.
I scoffed under my breath. “What does he know. He’s missing brain matter. His qualifications to judge have been reduced by a gram or two.”
A puff of air left Katherine’s nose as she smiled, attempting to hold back her laughter. “He has been acting a little…different lately.”
I tilted my chin in question. “How so?” I wondered if it was anything I could exploit.
She folded her lips into a thin line before finally elaborating. “Just little things here and there. Shorter temper. Easily frustrated. Withdrawn. Some odd confusion he won’t admit to.”
Confusion? Now that was something I might be able to work with. “Confusion about what?”
Katherine’s eyes suddenly shifted to Sloane who remained standing behind me right in front of the couch. “I probably shouldn’t say.”
I pursed my lips, trying to find a way to justify her divulgence. “Katherine, if he’s getting confused by things he shouldn’t be, it might
be something Sid or Darren will want to know. We don’t want him to be a liability.”
I pinned her with my stare as I waited for her to find her courage.
She sighed and then sagged her shoulders. “Like I said, just little things. Forgetting things I know I told him. Odd misunderstandings and overreactions. Frequent pauses mid-sentence. Misinterpreting my words. Delayed reactions.”
My eyes scanned her face as she spoke, catching the fear reflecting in her eyes, especially when they slid back to Ella.

“Has he been violent?” I asked.
Katherine looked away until her gaze fell to the floor, a small nod following.
Rage ripped through my blood at the idea of Daniel hurting his already fragile, healing wife.
Piece of shit.
“I’m sorry, Katherine,” I murmured. “For everything you went through.
The attack must have been horrifying.”
She nodded. “Believe it or not, it’s not the first time I’ve survived an attack like that. But it was the first time I’ve experienced it as a mother,” she said sadly.
“Try not to dwell on it,” I attempted to soothe her. “You both made it out. Ella is fine, and you will be too. You just have to take it one day at a time.” I wished there was something else I could say that would make things better, but there was nothing either one of us could do.
At least for now.
If Daniel was as volatile as I thought he was, I would need to be tactful in my approach.
A few seconds later, a breaking news bulletin caught my attention, drawing my eyes away to the screen of the TV. Suspicion threaded through my brain as the story of a long time United States General had reportedly been arrested along with several members of his commanding unit for various war crimes, conspiracy, and extortion. An older man with a very familiar last name. Rainer.
My eyes narrowed on the picture, looking for similarities. Was there a family connection or was I just reaching for—
“Who’s your new friend?” Katherine suddenly asked, interrupting my thoughts as she glanced up at Sloane.
I didn’t want to, but I took her bait to change the subject.

“New bodyguard,” I answered, as my eyes peeked back toward the TV screen to continue my scrutiny.
From the corner of my eye, I could see Katherine’s brows furrow. “What happened to Clive and Owen?”
I swallowed back my dread. I didn’t know why I was thinking I could avoid this question. I knew eventually she would ask. Maybe I just didn’t want to relive their deaths by having to explain them, but I had to get over it sooner or later.
Giving up on the news story, I returned my full attention to Katherine, knowing there would be a lot of follow up questions.
“I was attacked when we were in Chicago,” I explained, dryly swallowing back my misplaced grief. “They didn’t make it.”
Katherine’s gaze suddenly grew wide with concern as they bounced up and down my hunched over form. “You were attacked? No one told me! Oh my, God, Jaden, are you okay? What happened?”
I tilted my head in surprise that she was kept this much in the dark, even though I really shouldn’t be. I had a feeling the only reason Darren told me about their attack was to explain why they were staying with us.
“You haven’t been told anything since you woke up?”
She shook her head. “No. Has something else happened? What have I missed?”
Damn. And here I thought I had it bad when it came to being kept in the dark.
“We—"
“Mrs. Davis,” Sloane interrupted sharply. “I’m not sure you should divulge. If her husband does not want her to know, it may be prudent to respect that.”
I turned my gaze back to her in irritation. “The man has brain damage, he probably just forgot. And if Darren didn’t want me to discuss a particular

topic with Katherine, he would have said so. As far as I’m concerned, this is fair game.”
Sloane was silent as she looked down at me, her stoic face giving off zero emotion. And then she dipped her chin. “Very well then,” she replied.
Turning back around, I proceeded to bring Katherine up to speed as to what had happened recently. The attack in Chicago, the attack at the country estate, and the disposal of Miguel Spade. By the time I was done, Katherine’s eyes were the size of saucers.
“My, God, Jaden, you’re sure you’re okay?” she asked, her voice thick with shock.
I smirked at her concern. “I’m fine. Just another Tuesday.” She blanched, clearly uncomfortable with my dismissal.
Our lunch arrived a few minutes later, the spread being placed out on the balcony so we could enjoy the sun. Katherine and I kept the subjects safe, speaking mostly about Ella and the status of their home.
Even though she was bound to this room, she coordinated with Carla to help with the reconstruction of their home and replacing the staff. Katherine was only too happy to have a purpose and to stay busy.
By the time lunch was over, I’d only gotten to spend maybe an hour with Katherine before Sloane was reminding me that my time was up. I wanted to argue, but I knew where that would land me.
So I begrudgingly hugged Katherine goodbye on her uninjured side and waved goodbye to Ella who sweetly waved back. I hated leaving them behind, but I was grateful for the time I did get to spend, even though it meant I’d probably have to grovel to Darren for allowing it.
And God knew he was going to exploit the shit out of that later. So naturally, when I met him for dinner, I made sure to keep a positive and appreciative attitude.
“It was really good to see Katherine today. Her wounds seem to be healing nicely."

Darren said nothing as I sliced through my roasted chicken with the side of my fork, thankful the meat was so tender that it cut through like butter. But the broodiness surrounding him was much tougher to slice through than my chicken. I needed to distract him with something more significant.
“Ella was super cute while I was there, too. I played peek-a-boo with her and—“
“Jaden,” Darren interrupted coldly. “What?”
“Put your left hand on the table.”
More anxiety cracked in my jaw as I clenched it, dreading the blow up that was about to happen.
“Before you freak out,” I started as I placed my arm on the table, “it was a total accid–,” But I didn’t get a chance to finish my sentence before Darren’s hand snatched my wrist to pin it in place and ripped back the bandage covering the top of my hand. His eyes lit up with a bright fury, but I hurried to douse those flames. “See, it’s not even that bad. Just a couple of scratches. No big deal.”
But still Darren said nothing. Instead, he abruptly stood from his chair, nearly knocking it over and stormed his way into the kitchen where Camaro was eating her own dinner.
“Darren, wait! Stop!” I shouted as I rushed after him, dashing around him to place myself between him and my dog. “It was an accident, Darren! My hand got in the way of the Frisbee she was fetching and she accidentally bit down. She immediately pulled back when she realized what had happened!”
Darren’s eyes shot to me. “She still bit you, Jaden. That’s unacceptable.”
“She didn’t mean it! My hand is fine! Please, just listen to me!”
Darren shook his head, his glare baring down at Camaro as she whimpered from the floor behind me. “Please, Darren, don’t take her from

me. You know how much she means to me. I need her in my life.”
“And I need you in mine,” he affirmed, stepping closer to tower over me. “This will be your one and only warning, Jaden,” he said evenly. “If Camaro causes you harm one more time, accidental or not, she’s done. That also includes you risking your life for hers. Do you hear me? Either she will succumb to her injuries or I will put her down myself. I will not have you dying for a fucking dog. Do you understand?”
My heart was breaking with every threat, my breath getting caught in my throat as I attempted to acknowledge him.
“Okay,” I murmured, my heart slowly cracking open.
“She’s a goddamn guard dog, Jaden. Not a pet. Her job is to protect you, and if she isn’t going to do that, she’s useless to me. Do you understand?”
She’s never useless to me. “Yes, I understand.”
“Good. Camaro’s days have always been numbered, Jaden. Try not to hasten them.”
Darren then turned around and left the kitchen, leaving me to finally collapse onto the floor next to my dog, my one and only friend. I clutched her tightly to me, terrified of what the future held for her. I didn’t want to see her end up the same way as Clive and Owen and I didn’t know what I would do if Darren forced her down that path.
I just had to hope I would never find out.





49.

FINALLY.









Jaden’s hips slammed against my desk, my cock pounding in and out of her soaking-wet pussy that clung to me like a fucking lifeline. Bent over the hard surface, she clutched the edges, holding tight as she hissed and
moaned through every stroke.
Primal satisfaction ran deep as I claimed what was mine, knowing my efforts would eventually lead to the ultimate reward.
Jaden’s dress and bra lay discarded on the floor in ribbons, the only item of clothing left being the string of pearls that teased along my shaft. If you could even call that clothing.
This particular set had two parallel strings that allowed my cock to spear between each one, the additional stimulation an interesting mix with Jaden’s tight heat.
I’d been fucking her like this for nearly two months now, keeping her constantly in need, eager to bend over any surface I forced her up against. It was a brilliant way to ensure she was constantly filled with my cum, and the thought alone was enough to keep me hard practically all damn day.
If I wanted to get her pregnant, I needed to make sure my seed was constantly coating  her  womb.  Ialready  had  Sid  initiate  the  fertility

treatments, my eagerness and impatience incompatible with female biology. I was tired of waiting for the things that I wanted. Time could go fuck itself.
A notification pinged on my phone, indicating a new email with an attachment had come in, and then Scott’s name appeared on the caller ID.
Fucking finally.
Swiping the answer button, I put the call on speakerphone and addressed Scott. “That had better be the report I’ve been waiting for,” I told him as I continued to press into Jaden. When she noticed the call was on speakerphone and I wasn’t stopping, she gasped an adorable sort of screech and tried to move away to avoid being heard. I pushed my hand down on the middle of her spine to keep her in place. “Stop it. You’re fine,” I ordered, continuing my pace without pause.
“You busy?” Scott asked from the other line.
“When am I not busy?” I replied as Jaden quickly buried her face into the cover of her arms, attempting to muffle any sound I had been previously enjoying behind her now sealed lips.
I chuckled softly at her sudden desperation for modesty, finding it cute that she was trying to hide herself from Scott’s ears.
Scott ignored what was likely obvious to him and continued. “The numbers are better than we thought.”
Grabbing my phone, I thumbed through the email app until I came across the report I had been waiting on. Swiping through the pages, I continued to slowly fuck Jaden while reviewing the data I needed, the corners of my lips curling in victory.
Matt’s company, Rainer Industries, had finally released its second- quarter numbers, reporting a devastating loss in shares and plummeting stock value by a good 11.2 percent. After rumors had spread of Matt’s family ties to the disgraced United States general and his possible involvement in his uncle’s war crimes, remaining in business with Rainer Industries was no longer ideal or profitable.

A muffled cry snuck past Jaden’s lips as my cock bumped against her G-spot, causing her body to stiffen with tension as her pussy clenched around me. A smirk formed on my lips as she did her best to pretend she wasn’t even here. But with my other hand returning to grasp tightly against her hip, I refused to let her.
“How many suppliers have already withdrawn their contracts?” I asked, Jaden’s muscles locking up as she attempted to hold back the orgasm I was intentionally building inside her.
She gave voice to her disapproval of my continued conversation with Scott with a little exacerbated grunt, her hands clenching into fists at the back of her head until her knuckles turned white.
“Seven so far, and I’m not sure if Matt will even have the funds to sue for the breaches of contract by then,” he answered smugly.
Jaden finally lost the fight, and her pussy abruptly locked down on my cock, clenching hard as her body tensed up. My grin widened, knowing she was starting to come as another stifled whimper escaped her lips. She fell apart right there on my desk.
“Keep an eye on it. If the shares get any lower, I may just initiate a hostile takeover,” I said, another burst of dopamine entering my bloodstream at the thought of owning Matt’s company just so I could burn it to the fucking ground.
Hanging up, I turned my attention back to my wife, who was still convulsing from the aftershocks of her not-so-subtle orgasm.
“Did you really think you were going to escape my cock just because Scott was on the phone?” I taunted as I leaned over her stretched-out spine. I thrust in deep then, causing her head to pop back up on a gasped moan she didn’t bother to fight. “Did you enjoy coming for an audience?”
Jaden groaned with an animalistic ferocity, her nails digging into the wood of my desk as I picked up my pace, fucking her harder and faster than before. I would admire those scratches in my desk later.

“You’re a jerk,” Jaden hissed, arching her spine to accommodate her position.
Snatching her hair, I yanked her head back, holding her in place before sharply smacking the side of her ass, causing her to suck in a sharp breath.
“And you’re mine,” I rasped, driving in and out of her with the kind of brutality that had her clenching around me all over again. “You’ll come where I want and when I want.”
Zoning in, I pushed her over the edge again, a loud cry of desperation echoing from her throat. Her pussy seized around me, gushing that liquid heat and bringing me right over the edge with her. I groaned as I emptied myself inside her, pushing my cum as deep as I possibly could and holding myself in place.
Releasing Jaden’s hair, she fell forward onto the desk, limp and pliable as her breath came in and out in heavy gusts. A light sheen of sweat coated her back, her hair a wild mess that fell in every direction as she tried to smooth it away from her flushed face. But when her breathing didn’t slow down like I expected it to, I grew concerned.
“What’s wrong?” I asked, leaning closer to push more of her hair out of her face so I could see her eyes.
“I feel…” She sounded confused as her words came out breathy and quiet. “I just feel a little dizzy.”
Gently pulling out, I slowly turned her onto her side, her breathing remaining exactly the same.
“Look at me,” I ordered.
She tilted her head, and her eyes tried to find mine, but they seemed to have trouble focusing on one single point.
“I think…I think I just need to lie down for a second,” she murmured softly.
At times like these, my first instinct was usually to call Sid because my paranoia always got the best of me when it came to Jaden. But I needed to

stop relying on him for every little thing when I was more than capable of taking care of my wife when she was unwell.
I may not have a medical license, but I had more than enough knowledge and experience to keep myself and others around me alive.
Scanning every feature of her face, I searched for any additional symptoms aside from her dizziness. Her pupils were slightly dilated, which could be due to the overload of dopamine I just gave her a few moments ago.
“Does your head hurt at all?” I asked, hoping for the negative. She lightly shook her head. “No.”
I released a subtle sigh of relief, then stood to rearrange my pants before gathering her in my arms and carrying her to the nearby couch. Gently laying her down, I placed her head against the throw pillow and then took her small wrist in my hand to feel her pulse. It was racing.
“When did you last eat?” I asked, trying not to sound too angry.
She licked at her dry lips, her breaths finally slowing but not enough for my liking.
“This morning,” she answered. “Oatmeal, toast, and a bowl of fruit.”
Crouching beside her, I felt her forehead, satisfied that she wasn’t overheating.
“Did you go outside today?”
She shrugged as she closed her eyes for a moment. “I went for a jog earlier.”
Exhaling a slow breath, I pushed my own unruly hair out of my eyes. “It’s ninety-five degrees outside today. You might just be dehydrated.”
I stood back up and strode over to the mini fridge near the bar. After retrieving one of the water bottles, I unscrewed the cap and crouched down again to hold it to Jaden’s lips. She took the bottle in her hand and held it steady as she took a few tentative sips.

For the next five minutes, I forced her to continue sipping the water until half of it was gone, and her breathing was finally back to a normal rate. Taking her wrist again, I was satisfied when her pulse finally slowed.
“Feeling better?” I asked, reaching up to tuck her hair behind her ear.
Jaden nodded slightly. “Yeah, the dizziness is mostly gone. I’m just a little cold now.”
She tried to sit up, but I just pushed her back down and shook my head. “I want you to rest for a little while,” I said as I grabbed the throw
blanket folded over the back of the couch and draped it over her naked body.
She gripped the ends of the blanket in her hands and tucked them under her chin. After smoothing her hair down on the side of her head, I watched as Jaden closed her eyes, releasing a quiet breath as she burrowed deeper into the pillow.
Pressing a gentle kiss to her forehead, I inhaled deeply, relishing in her soft scent before standing to my full height and heading for the door to my office.
Opening it, I blew out a soft whistle and waited for Camaro to hustle past me, moving straight to Jaden. She sniffed her sleeping form for a few seconds before she was content enough to yawn and lay down on the floor beside the couch.
Quietly closing the door, I strolled back over to stand in front of the couch, remarking on the scene before me. Safely tucked away in my office, Jaden’s small frame was swallowed up by the blanket as she slept while Camaro stood watch.
It was like everything was suddenly right with the world, like everything was exactly as it should be. And very soon, it would be even better.
I’d already deduced that Jaden’s dizziness could have come from the hormone fluctuations I was secretly putting her through, which could also

be a sign of ovulation. Only time would tell.
Returning to my desk, I focused on work, busying myself to avoid lingering too long on the fact that Jaden was still naked under that blanket. I still needed to look into the latest tips that had come in on Matt’s whereabouts. The fucker seemed to just disappear from the face of the earth.
Given the latest stain on his reputation and the fact he had about a dozen mercenaries on his back, he had nowhere else to go but to ground. But that didn’t mean he wasn’t still influencing things on the surface.
Three of my safe-houses had been breached in the past week at the same time, my underground vaults emptied and my artillery stolen. The whole operation cost me about thirty-six million dollars, a worthy pursuit for those brave enough to try.
But this group didn’t just try. They succeeded, most likely thanks to Matt. The fucker had more intel on me than I realized.
Someone had also tipped off some of the Mexican cartels about my secret little warehouse in Tijuana. Another five-million-dollar loss of weapons and drugs. I’d have to find a different port and warehouse to store those shipments if I wanted to continue easily distributing into Mexico.
There was still so much work to be done, and it didn’t help that my brother was not only completely useless, he was causing me more headaches than I had time for. He’d been discharged weeks ago from Sid’s care, but he was still far from fit to fight in my opinion. Unsurprisingly, Daniel didn’t give a shit about what I thought.
I knew his behavior was going to be an adjustment as he learned to navigate life with his brain injury. He’d assembled his own efforts to locate Matt, but so far, he’d come up with just as much nothing as me. He was still determined to beat the mercs I had hunting Matt down.
Personally, I didn’t care as long as he didn’t disrupt their efforts.

But he was certainly disrupting my home life. Twice in the last week, I’d caught him fucking some of my maids, who were very clearly not interested in the engagement. I’d been furious and had to quickly morph into damage control mode.
My staff was loyal because I paid them well for their silence, protected them from harm, and treated them with respect and dignity while instilling a healthy dose of fear should their loyalties ever think to shift. Some of them were here by choice. Others were here because they had no alternative.
But if my brother thought he could disrupt the peace and structure of my home, he was dead fucking wrong. I gave him one final warning that if he fucked with my household in any way, he’d be out on his ass, brother or not. I
had enough chaos going on, thanks to him. I would not allow him to add more, especially since I was busy trying to actually create things instead of destroying them.
Lately, I had preferred to spend the majority of my time reinforcing my relationships with my allies, creating meaningful business transactions and finding new sources for product production.
With the Lobos gone and the fields destroyed, we’d lost a good chunk of revenue that needed to be replenished elsewhere. So far, Scott and I had yet to find a suitable replacement, and it was becoming problematic. I had a feeling I would need to start renegotiating contracts with certain associates very soon.
After about thirty minutes, I heard Jaden groan uncomfortably, creating an odd grumble of noises before she abruptly jerked to the side and vomited all over my father’s favorite and most expensive rug. Camaro jumped back with a whine to escape the splash, whimpering in a panic as she sniffed the air.
“Oh God,” Jaden croaked as she looked down at the mess in horror.
“I’m sorry. It just came up so fast, I didn’t have any time. I don’t know

where that came from.”
I felt the corners of my lips slowly curl upward.
Fucking finally.





50.

EXPECTED.









I woke with my stomach twisting away in my gut, the sudden need to vomit incredibly overwhelming. Ripping the covers off me, I yanked myself out from under Darren’s heavy arm and raced to the bathroom, just
barely making it to the toilet.
Luckily, there wasn’t much left in my stomach to throw up, but my abdomen clenched painfully all the same.
When I was finished, I dragged myself to the sink to brush my teeth. “You okay?” Darren asked from the doorway.
“I’m fine. Just a little nausea.” “Still?”
I side-eyed him before spitting into the sink, irritated by the fact that this was the third time this week I’d vomited. I’d been feeling shitty for the past couple of days, and as best as I tried to hide it, Sloane caught on too quickly.
I could battle the headaches and fatigue all day, but nausea was an entirely different beast.
And the last thing I wanted to deal with was being forced back into another round of mandatory bullshit bedrest.

“Yeah. Still.”
Bypassing Darren through the door, I went back to the bed to lie down, hoping to quell some of the unpleasant aftereffects. Darren silently followed and sat down beside me, his warm hand pressing against my forehead.
“You don’t have a fever,” he noted, pushing my hair from my face.
Looking up at the clock, it was about 7 a.m., too early for me, but I doubted Darren would go back to sleep now.
“I just want to lie here for a little while.”
Darren sighed, his big shoulders sagging while his thumb stroked the side of my jaw.
“I’ll have Sid come see you again this afternoon,” he said, the hint of an odd smile on his lips as he leaned down to kiss me on the forehead.
“Thank you.”
After he left for the day, I kept my ass in bed, breathing through the nausea until I was able to fall back asleep, waking up another hour later. I found Camaro lying down just next to the bed, my arm able to reach her head for scratches from where I lay. I still felt bad that I’d almost vomited on her just a few days ago.
When I felt fine enough, I got up from the bed to take a quick shower, hoping the water would bring back some energy. When it didn’t, I forced myself to get dressed anyway, moving at a fucking snail’s pace until I made it out the bedroom door.
“Oh, you are awake,” Sloane said from my right. “Feeling any better?” “Not really, but I’ll be okay. I’m going to go down to see Sid.” I didn’t
feel like waiting for him to come find me. “Then I will accompany you.”
I waved her off. “Oh no, you know you don’t have to do that—”
“My orders came directly from Mr. Davis this morning. You are not well and should not be left unattended for any reason.”

I cocked a brow at her. A potential stomach bug should not warrant this much attention. “If you insist,” I replied with a yawn, slowly making my way to the infirmary with Camaro and Sloane at my side.
Sid was studying something in his office, his expression a little more bleak than usual. He actually looked nervous for some reason.
“Still not feeling good, eh?” he asked me before coughing to clear the odd hoarseness from his voice.
I shook my head, watching as Sloane moved to stand against the wall. “Not sure what’s going on, but I’ve just been feeling pretty shitty.”
His brows furrowed. “For how long now?”
I shrugged my shoulders as I stepped up. “Few days.”
Sid’s eyes bounced up and down my form, his mouth forming a tight line as he scrutinized me. But I found myself doing the same to him, noticing the dark circles under his eyes and the droopy lids that nearly covered them. His face had been looking very gaunt lately, but his cheeks appeared a little swollen today.
“Okay, well,” he groaned as he stood from his desk, a subtle wheeze in his breath. “Let’s draw some blood and run some tests.”
Three vials of blood later, Sid had also taken my blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, listened to my lungs, and then went over my symptoms.
“You should have come in sooner, Jaden. I don’t know why you try to hide your ailments.”
I scoffed. “It’s just a stupid stomach bug. It’s not like I’m dying, Sid.” I eyed him closely, wondering if he would catch on to the hint that I knew which one of us actually was. He didn’t. That, or he just ignored it.
“Yeah, well, hiding symptoms just makes my job harder. I’ll be back with your test results in a little bit.”
Sid left the room with my blood, leaving me alone with Sloane and Camaro. Getting up from the medical table, I walked over to the leather

couch against the wall and lay down, Camaro followed me to plop down in front of the couch.
Sitting up was difficult to do when my stomach still felt off. I wondered what the fuck I had eaten that would cause me to feel like this. Or maybe I’d caught a bug from one of the guards? Oh god, what if it was because Camaro had bitten me? Darren would be fucking furious if her bite mark caused me to get sick.
Twenty anxious minutes later, I’d practically jumped from the couch when Sid walked back into the room, Darren right behind him. My brows knit together in confusion.
Why was Darren here?
Maybe you really are dying?
I cautiously stood from the couch, my hands automatically clenching into tight fists at my sides. “What’s going on?”
Darren’s eyes locked with mine, a hardness set in his fascial features while his jaw clenched like he was preparing for a fight. I felt my stomach roil.
“Sloane, take Camaro with you and give us the room, please,” he ordered, the weight of his stare still holding me in place.
My stomach dropped even harder as I watched Sloane collect Camaro and walk out of the room, the click of the door shutting suddenly making it difficult to breathe.
Oh, shit, maybe I really was dying.
With Sloane and Camaro gone, Darren released a deep sigh and placed his hands in his pockets, finally glancing over at Sid.
Taking the cue, Sid finally spoke. “Well, Jaden, it seems we have some very good news to share.”
My eyes slid back and forth between him and Darren, the idea of good news sounding like an ominous trick. I could feel myself starting to panic inside, my heart rate elevating as my breath hitched. But when my gaze

caught the sly grin hiding in the corner of Darren’s lips, I felt all the blood leave my face.
No.
No. No. No.
“Turns out, you’re not actually sick at all, Jaden,” Sid continued. “You’re just pregnant. Congratulations.”
And just like that, a bomb went off in the room.
Suddenly, the only thing I could hear was my racing heartbeat mixed with that awful ringing. A wave of dizziness threw off my balance as my stomach clenched from an invisible blow to the gut. My breath caught in my throat, denial trying to convince me I had to have misheard Sid.
My mind went completely blank, like reality was just a whirlwind of white noise and I was only dreaming. It was just a figment of my imagination.
But that familiar stab of ice-cold terror shot its way up my spine as the heartbreak of another betrayal smacked me right in the face. With my mouth quickly drying up, I found it difficult to speak.
“What?” It was all I could manage to say.
Darren’s head tilted forward. “You heard him, Jaden.”
My focus glazed off to the side, my brain trying to wrap around how it was possible. But it couldn’t be.
“No, that can’t be right,” I argued, looking at Sid for validation. “We replaced my birth control implant. I can’t be…be…”
Sid’s gaze wavered as his eyes fell to the floor. “Well, actually, Jaden, we—”
“Your replacement was a dud, Jaden,” Darren answered plainly for him. I felt my entire body harden in place. “A…a dud?”
“You’ve been off birth control for the last two months.”
Oh, God, I was going to vomit again. This couldn’t be happening. Two months? My eyes locked with Sid’s, looking for the confirmation that he

had conspired with Darren to trick me like this. But the guilt and regret coating his face told me the horrible truth.
I sucked in a breath of disbelief, horror drenching my voice. “Why?”
Darren tilted his head, his stare narrowing like I’d just asked a stupid question.
“You know why.”
My eyes fell from his to the floor as my brain worked through the web of denial I was still trying to spin inside. But as my hands moved to clutch my lower abdomen, the proof hit me there just like another bullet.
Suddenly, all the fucking we’d been doing made sense. He had been trying to get me pregnant the entire time. And he apparently had succeeded. “You…” I started, still working to accept what was happening. “You
lied to me. You both fucking lied to me!”
Darren’s expression didn’t change, his hardened features unwavering in the face of my obvious distress. Instead, he just tilted his head, his voice cold and detached.
“A lie would imply that I told you something I knew was false. I’ve always been honest about what I expect from you, Jaden, especially as my wife.”
My eyes widened from his sheer audacity to spin this with his typical twisted bullshit logic.
“It’s still deception!” I argued. “You’ve—”
“Deception?” he mocked, cutting me off. “You mean like how you deliberately deceived me to help Kayla escape? When you lied and told everyone she was dead? That kind of deception?”
My stomach flipped at the memory of what he’d done to me for helping Kayla and covering for her. Regret snaked through my blood, wishing now I had made a different decision back then. My jaw clenched hard as my fists curled in anger.

“Yeah,” I murmured, my voice dropping low as I prepared for the worst. “I can see how much of a mistake that was now. A mistake that I didn’t go with her!”
Darren jolted forward, a snarl on his face as his arm began to rise. “Darren, stop!” Sid grabbed his arm to yank him back, but the attempt made Darren turn to grip Sid’s shirt and shove him against the wall. Wrenching the door open, Darren held Sid fast as he tried to hold on to Darren’s wrist, clinging to his plea. “You can’t hurt her! Not when she’s carrying your child!”
“Get the fuck out, Sid,” Darren snarled as he threw him through the doorway and slammed the door shut. When he turned back around, the dangerous look he gave me should have left me terrified, but I was too pissed off to care. “You were doing so well,” he commented, shaking his head. “I’m disappointed but not surprised.”
My brow rose. “Did you honestly expect me to weep with joy?” “No. But a simple nod of acceptance would have been fine.”
I scoffed in disbelief. “You lied to me and tricked me into a false sense of security so you could be free to fucking impregnate me without any adversity. And you expect me to just accept that?!”
“Watch your mouth,” Darren warned, taking a menacing step toward me. “You knew this was coming. You knew what I wanted. And you know I will do whatever it takes to get what I want.”
“So you thought you’d just keep this little scheme all to yourself? Just blindside me out of nowhere when you finally succeeded? Why the hell wouldn’t you just tell me?”
Darren took another step forward, making me back up one. “Like you just said, avoiding adversity. I knew you would try to sabotage my efforts,” he answered, fury lacing his voice. “I chose an effective, less combative path.”
I screeched in disgust. “You mean you chose a cowardly path!”

His eyes blazed with a barely contained rage, and I was so ready to pull that final trigger. “It doesn’t matter what you think, Jaden. It never has. What’s done is done. Now accept it.”
Enraged, I immediately grabbed the closest thing within my reach and flung a book right at Darren’s head. He dodged it, but I kept throwing anything I could touch.
“You lying piece of shit!” A glass vase shattered against the wall as it flew past his shoulder, followed by a lamp that crashed into a picture frame on Sid’s desk. “I can’t believe you did this to me!”
Anger and panic like I’d never experienced before erupted inside me so violently, I had zero hope of containing it. The white-hot and blinding rage destroyed whatever perfect little wifely image I had created, and bore itself a monster.
He shifted his shoulder again, dodging most of the chess pieces I’d grabbed to fling at him. His eyes promised me regret if I didn’t stop, but that train left the brakes at the station.
“I suggest you calm down before you hurt yourself and our baby,” he warned as he took the brunt of the coasters I snatched from somewhere.
“Arhh! Shut up!” I screamed, covering my ears with my hands, hating every word he said.
I didn’t know what made me do it, but all reason went right out the window as I reached down and grabbed my butterfly knife that I often kept hidden in my bra. I had it flipped open and soaring through the air before I could even think about it.
As Darren lunged for me, the blade pierced right into his thigh, mere inches from his femoral artery. He paused mid-stride as he looked down at the knife now sticking out of his leg.
His jaw clenched as he sighed through his nose, barely even grunting as he yanked the knife out and chucked it on the floor. When his dark eyes met mine, deep-seated dread tore through my stomach.

He charged at me, stepping right into my kick aimed at his abdomen, taking the brunt of it without a single flinch, and nearly knocking me off balance as he bulldozed into me. When I swayed backward to catch myself, Darren reached out to snatch both of my wrists and yanked me to his chest.
“Get off me!” I screamed, jerking at his iron grip. “Get the fuck off me—”
“Enough!” he bellowed, causing me to instantly stiffen, my eyes refusing to look up at him. “You knew this day was coming. This should not be a surprise. Accept it and move on.”
I pushed against his chest, hoping to break free of his hold, but he wouldn’t budge, not a single muscle. And the harder I fought to get away, the harder it was to hold back the tears of betrayal that ran down my face.
“You could have told me the truth! Instead, you hid it from me the whole time! You’re nothing but a fucking cowardice snake!”
Darren then rearranged both my wrists into one hand and wrapped the other around my jaw, squeezing far too tightly.
“Careful, my little wife. You may be carrying my child, but that doesn’t exempt you from the consequences of disrespect. This is supposed to be a happy moment for us—”
“This was never going to be a happy moment for us,” I growled, rage grating my voice.
His features darkened. “Why? Because it makes it harder for you to try to leave me now? Is that what you’re still hung up about? That last flicker of hope gone?”
“I don’t want to bring a child into your world just so you can torture it into a monster like YOU!”
Darren smirked then, releasing my jaw with a humorous breath on his lips.
“Tough shit. Securing a legacy is what keeps us in business, keeps us safe as we age. It’s time for you to fulfill that duty to keep this family

secure.”
I scoffed. “Fuck you, your legacy, and your family! I can’t believe you fucking did this to me!”
Darren then shoved my upper body over the couch, pinning me in place. “Believe that it’s going to happen again and again and again until I have
as many heirs as I fucking want from you,” he growled, lifting my skirt. “No! Don’t you dare fucking touch m—”
He was inside me before I could finish my sentence, his steel cock stretching me wide and causing me to cry out. For once, I was grateful the pearls had served me their protective purpose. Gripping my hair, Darren yanked my head back and brought his mouth to my ear.
“This body is mine,” he growled, thrusting deep. “You are mine. And I will do with you as I always have—whatever the fuck I want. I thought you understood this by now.”
His cock rammed in and out of me with such force, his punishing thrusts reminding me exactly why it was futile to argue with him.
“I’ll never trust your word again,” I muttered through gritted teeth.
“I don’t fucking care, Jaden. You’ll do what I say regardless. Do you understand?”
When I didn’t answer, he yanked my hair so hard I thought it would rip from my scalp.
“I said, do you understand?” he growled, purposely thrusting right into my cervix.
I cried out as my nails dug into the leather couch. “Yes.”
He then shoved the side of my head down into the cushion, his hips bucking into mine with animalistic ferocity.
“Who owns you?” he growled down at me, shoving his cock in even deeper.
I gasped in pain, attempting to pull away from the pressure, but he just yanked me back even harder.

“Answer me.”
“You do, you fucking bastard,” I muttered blankly, gritting my teeth as he surged inside me.
“Why am I doing this?”
As his cock continued to spear in and out of me, it dawned on me that even though he was hurting me, my body was still preparing to come. I fucking hated myself sometimes.
“Because you want to,” I murmured, not even bothering to mask the misery in my voice.
“That’s right. And you’ll fucking take it like the good girl I trained you to be.”
My heart didn’t have the will to fight him anymore. Devastation weighed heavy on my limbs as Darren let out the last of his rage on me, fucking me through my humiliating orgasm until he reached his own satisfaction.
When he was finished, he pulled out and tucked his cock back into his pants. He then grabbed my hips and flipped me over, taking my face in one of his hands.
“You have three days to come to terms with this. Three days to mope around and sort through your emotions. And when your pity party time comes to an end, there will be no more complaints. You will prepare for motherhood, whether you’re ready for it or not. Am I clear?”
I could barely stand to answer him. “Yes,” I whispered as his hot cum leaked down the side of my leg.
“Good girl. Now tell me you love me,” he ordered.
I felt my jaw clamp shut, a sickening feeling storming in my stomach, tearing me apart. When his gaze sharpened at my hesitation, I knew my time was up. But at that moment, I had one flicker of rage still left alive.
I shook my head and snarled. “I fucking hate you!”

Darren’s eyes blazed with fury before he reared back and smacked me hard across the face, pain instantly flaring in my cheek. Wrapping his entire hand around my throat, he yanked me closer and squeezed.
“Say the fucking words, or you won’t see Camaro until our child is born,” he threatened, his voice so sharp it cut right to the bone. My heart tore itself in half at his demand, a sob scratching up my throat as several tears escaped down my face.
“I love you,” I muttered through gritted teeth, wishing I could die at that very moment.
A cruel grin curled his lips, his eyes flashing with sinister satisfaction as he basked in his victory. And then he leaned in and kissed me, claiming my mouth with the same ferocity he had on my body. And as more tears spilled down my cheeks, I could feel his thumb gently wiping them away.
When he finally pulled back, he released my face with a victorious smirk on his own, and stood to his full towering height.
“See you at dinner.” With a snicker, he turned to leave the room, collecting my knife from the floor before shutting the door behind him.
My knees gave out a second later, causing me to collapse in a heap onto the floor, surrounded by the mess and absolute chaos I could never escape.
And now… everything was lost.





51.

WEAPONIZED.









Irritation boiled through my veins as I left Jaden behind in Sid’s office. Sloane gave me an odd look as I passed her without acknowledgment, her eyes flashing with what I recognized as concern. But then she schooled herself quickly, waiting for me to get halfway down the hall before
reentering Sid’s office and finding the mess of a little brat I’d left behind.
Jaden’s reaction had been a little more heated than expected, but nothing I couldn’t handle. The only surprising part was that she actually managed to stab me in the fucking leg. She’d pulled it out so fast and had it in the air before I realized what it even was.
I thought it might have been another piece from Sid’s chessboard, not caring if it hit me. But when I felt the sudden sting in my leg, I was in damn near disbelief not only at her recklessness but also her accuracy.
She’d almost hit my femoral artery, barely just a few centimeters away. I would have bled out in minutes had we not been inside the convenience of an underground hospital wing.
Thankfully, it looked like she wasn’t really aiming for anything specific when she threw it. If I knew she had actually tried to kill me, things might

have ended a little differently. Either way, she wouldn’t be getting that butterfly knife back for a long time, if ever.
As I stormed back to my office, charged heat expanded in my chest, the warmth radiating in waves that warned my guards to steer far away as they passed by. Jaden was finally pregnant. My goal had been achieved and I was going to be a father—I should be fucking elated. But all I could think about was Jaden’s absolute hysteria.
I knew this was going to happen, knew she would be pissed that I had purposely kept my actions from her. Her anger had been enough to actually allow her to bypass her fear of me, giving her the strength to defy me and scream that she fucking hated me instead. So why the hell was I so bothered by it? I’d never cared before. I usually enjoyed it most times.
It wasn’t exactly a secret that she didn’t want to bear my children, and maybe that was the problem. Did I want her to want to have my kids? Maybe. It sure as shit would make things a lot easier right now. A united front on at least one mutual goal would have been nice to experience for once.
But that was the other problem—our goals were not aligned.
Would she act like this every time I got her pregnant? Probably— especially if I continued to keep my intentions a secret. Or maybe she would eventually come to appreciate the family she helped create and would grow to love. Just like she would eventually grow to love me—even if it took decades.
In my office, I found Scott and Daniel engaged in what sounded like a heated argument, their voices cutting off the second they heard me enter. Both their heads turned, their eyes observing my obvious mood before they traveled down to the bloodstain no doubt growing on my pants.
“What the hell happened to your leg?” Daniel asked, his brow rising in surprise.

I sighed as I rounded my desk and pulled out the first-aid kit to patch up the bleeding that continued trickling down my leg.
“What were you two arguing about?”
There was an annoying pause in the air before Scott caught on to my lingering rage and finally answered.
“Daniel wants Lessner dead.”
I scoffed with a quiet laugh. “And why the hell would he want that for our long-time family accountant?”
Ripping the tear Jaden’s knife had made in my pants, I tore it open so I could get a better look at the damage she’d done.
Goddamnit, it needs fucking stitches.
“Because he’s a huge liability that we can’t afford to have right now. He knows too much,” Daniel answered. “I think it’s time we cut him loose. I’ll manage the accounts.”
I almost snorted, but hummed my acknowledgment instead, ignoring the urge to laugh at the very idea as I opened the kit to begin cleaning my wound. Daniel’s brain damage really was going to be a problem if this was how he was thinking now.
“Daniel, that man has more extensive security than the fucking Pope, and you know this. Why are you suddenly so paranoid?”
“I’m just being proactive,” he practically growled. “The less people involved in our business the better.”
I stared at him for a moment, wondering if that was the actual truth before returning to threading the needle and making the first stitch.
“Should we off all of our lawyers then too? Or maybe even our investment analysts? What about our chefs? Are they not all liabilities too?” “Don’t be a condescending prick, Darren. I’m just looking out for our
family.”
“You haven’t even stated why you think it’s even necessary,” I reminded him.

By the time I completed the second stitch, Daniel still hadn’t answered me until I raised my irritated gaze to his.
“Just a strong feeling,” he finally murmured. I made a point not to roll my eyes.
Yeah, like I’m going to respect the intuition of a guy with a literal piece of his brain missing.
“Well, until that feeling turns into an actual fact I can verify myself, I want you to leave Ron alone. He’s looking into a potential hostile takeover of Rainer Industries for me and he’s the only one I trust to do it properly.”
Daniel gritted his teeth. “You shouldn’t be trusting anyone right now, Darren.”
“Does that include you and your judgment?” I barked, glaring at him before taping the final piece of gauze over the four stitches I had made.
Daniel’s exaggerated groan was cut off by Scott’s sudden interruption as I returned the first aid kit to its cabinet.
“Ok, enough ladies, onto the next line of drama. What did you do that made Jaden stab you just now?”
I could feel my eyes blazing with annoyance as they shot up to meet his, the flames increasing as I caught the humor lingering in his stare. Scott knew my wife too damn well—the fucker could clearly recognize her handiwork from across the damn room.
But instead of killing him for my irrational misplaced jealousy, I exhaled from the emotional exhaustion alone and revealed the “happy” news.
“I told her she was pregnant.”
Scott paused for a moment, staring at me with shock, and then immediately burst into a fit of laughter.
“And her reaction was to stab you? Fuck, that’s actually pretty hilarious.”
“Technically, she threw it at me,” I corrected.

“You mean that little purple one you got her for Christmas? I told you that was a bad idea, and you have the balls to question my judgment,” Daniel sneered with a dramatic eye-roll.
Scott continued his excessive chuckling. “Damn, she’s got a good arm if you didn’t catch it in time.”
I groaned in annoyance. “She threw it before I even realized what it was.”
“Sounds like you’re losing your touch,” Daniel commented, his eyes exuding a dark glower. “Tell me you left her in pieces for that.”
I leveled him with a glare of my own. “How I handle my wife is not your concern,” I warned him before throwing the bloodied cleaning cloths into the trash. “Also, I really love how the two of you are more focused on the fact that she stabbed me rather than the fact that she’s pregnant…with my child.”
I could see Daniel shaking his head from the corner of my eye. “Fine, Darren, Congratulations. It’s actually about time your wife fulfilled at least one of her duties, so it’s great to see she isn’t completely useless. But, seriously, if Katherine tried something like that, she wouldn’t be walking for days.”
For some reason, the word ‘useless’ stung in a way I didn’t expect.
Jaden hated that word, and I could understand why.
I dropped my chin and leaned on my knuckles against my desk, narrowing my gaze at my brother. “Well, it’s a good thing you’ve already beaten your useless wife into submission so she’d never even dream of it, let alone have the skill to accomplish it,” I shot back.
“Exactly, something you should have done to Jaden a long time ago,” he replied, his voice taking on a dark note.
I snarled at his growing arrogance. “I did, asshole. Don’t you remember? Her robotic devoted submission bored me. And clearly Katherine’s dull mousy subservience does the same for you, otherwise you

wouldn’t feel the need to force your dick down every warm hole you see. I’m not so desperate since I happen to have a wife who actually satisfies me so that I don’t need to look elsewhere.”
Daniel scoffed. “And look at what that satisfaction is costing you,” he argued, gesturing his hands through the air at my leg. “She disrespects you at every turn, practically tries to kill you, and you let her do it because you’re clearly so damn pussy-whipped!”
If he didn’t watch his own disrespect, he was in danger of ending up with his own stab wound as well.
“Watch it, Daniel. In case you weren’t aware,” I nearly growled, “that was the first time she’s acted out since I brought her back from the country estate. There are bound to be slip-ups from time to time. Slip-ups I enjoy punishing her for.”
“Ok, ok, drama aside, congratufuckulations, Darren, that’s awesome news, but can we please get back to the real reason we’re here?” Scott interrupted. “I don’t have time to listen to the two of you bicker all day. Rip each other’s throats out later. Right now, we have some serious problems on our hands.”
“What the fuck happened now?” I snapped.
“The brothels in Vegas were attacked all at once. Everyone is dead, and the girls are all missing,” Scott replied.
I sighed as a massive headache began to pound against my temples. With my wound clean and dressed, I sat down in my chair and pinched the bridge of my nose. This was the last fucking thing I needed right now.
“Looks like Matt is finally upping his game,” I commented, closing my eyes as I rubbed my temples. “Is that all?”
Daniel scoffed. “Is that all?” he mocked. “Darren, those whores could go to the fucking cops! We need to find them.”
How was my brother still this much of an idiot?

“They’re not going to go to the cops, you fucking amateur, because those whores are either dead or being sold elsewhere,” I assured him. “Matt wants us dead, not behind bars. We wouldn’t be in there for very long, and he knows that.”
“What if it’s not Matt?” Daniel argued.
I lifted my gaze and stared him down. “It’s Matt, and you know it.” “There’s another problem,” Scott added. “The turf is now swarming
with feds. We can’t move on it.”
I sighed, unsurprised there would be an investigation, and it would be a long time before those properties could be operational again.
“I’ll reach out to my contact and have him pull some strings. Those buildings are owned through a chain of shells and registered to a dead man. We have nothing to worry about. We’ll wait out the fire, and if anyone tries to move on our turf in the meantime, we’ll orchestrate another gang war to keep them occupied.”
Daniel’s eyes widened. “That’s also a significant amount of money lost, Darren!” he chided angrily. “Especially for that region.”
“We can afford it,” I reminded him.
I watched as his face started to redden. “I don’t care if—”
The doors to my office suddenly burst open, and the small frame of my wife barged in with an attitude like she was ready to set the place on fire. Camaro quickly trailed in after her, growling to herself.
“Mrs. Davis, stop!” Sloane called as she marched in behind her, but Jaden ignored her. “I’m sorry for her disruption, Mr. Davis,” she said as she tried to snatch Jaden’s arm, but she twisted out of her grasp easily.
“Back off, Sloane!” she barked, yanking her wrist away.
“Jaden, what the fuck are you doing?” I growled, my agitation with her defiance reaching an end. “Get upstairs. Now.”
“You wanna fuck up my world?” she snapped at me, eyes blazing with retribution. “Fine! Then watch me fuck up yours.” Her voice held an odd

tone of confidence, her white teeth bared with an animalistic ferocity my cock was more than ready to tame again. “Recognize this?” She lifted a book she had been holding by her side, showing me the front cover of something I hadn’t thought about in years. I narrowed my eyes at the tattered paperback version of Lord of the Flies by William Golding. “Your favorite book, right?” Jaden continued. She then opened the paperback and pulled out a folded piece of paper. “You’ll never guess what I found in it.” Holding up the folded paper, she tilted her head and glared at me. “A goodbye letter from your mother.” Her words had me pausing, wondering if I had heard her correctly. A goodbye letter? “Here, Daniel,” she said, handing him the paper.
I rounded my desk as Daniel unfolded it and started to read. Standing shoulder to shoulder, I looked over the words that were allegedly written by our own mother before she’d been killed.
The room was silent as Daniel and I absorbed the message she’d written just before we’d lost her. But the more I read, the hotter the rage grew in my blood.
How in the hell was this even possible?
“What the fuck,” Daniel whispered under his breath.
When I glanced back at Jaden, the grin she had on her face was dripping with a familiar triumph I recognized immediately. And it made me want to smack it right off her conniving little face.
“How does it feel?” she abruptly asked. “Knowing your helpless dying mother orchestrated her own assassination so she could frame an innocent family in hopes of freeing you both from your father’s insanity?” She stepped closer and pointed at the note still clinging between Daniel’s fingers. “She did all of that out of LOVE for her children even though it was completely deranged. She inadvertently destroyed multiple families in an attempt to save her sons from becoming the very monsters you allowed your father to turn you into!”

Everyone in the room stayed silent, the air filled with the kind of tension that could suffocate an entire stadium. I could feel Scott’s eyes boring into the back of my head as he watched the unfolding scene. Sloane essentially mirrored his actions. Daniel seemed to be too preoccupied with reading the letter over and over again to hear anything Jaden was saying.
“How long have you known about this?” I asked her pointedly.
She folded her arms across her chest and leaned on her hip. “Not long after you first brought me here.”
Fuck. That long ago?
“Does anyone else know?” Scott asked from behind me. Jaden eyed him as she slowly shook her head.
Snatching the letter from Daniel’s hand, I marched toward the fireplace behind me, crumpling the letter in my fist.
“Hey! What are you doing?” Daniel asked, his voice hitched.
Turning on the gas fireplace, I tossed the letter into the flames. My hands clutched tightly around the mantel as I watched the last words of my dead mother burn until they were nothing but specks of ash.
And then I forced that very same blaze to incinerate my feelings on the matter with it. I didn’t have time to process the actions of a dead woman. Right now, I needed to protect my family from the potential consequences of those actions.
“Why the hell did you do that? That was from Mom!” Daniel shouted angrily.
Turning back around, I leveled my brother with a reality check. “Because if that letter ever got out to anyone else, the repercussions could be astronomical to our reputation and credibility,” I answered firmly. “Everyone’s world changed because of that war, not just ours. If they knew it had all been based on nothing but complete bullshit created by a delusional dying woman, it would cause chaos everywhere.”

Daniel stayed silent for a moment as his eyes shifted to the floor, finally nodding in understanding. But when my gaze collided with Jaden’s hardened stare, I knew another war of epic proportions was brewing right before my eyes.
More withheld information she had no business knowing, more lies and omissions. The fact that she’d known this long and waited until this exact moment to reveal her little discovery told me she was much more conniving than I’d previously thought. And it made me wonder what else she was secretly hiding from me.
“Does Katherine know?” Daniel suddenly asked Jaden.
Her eyes narrowed as she frowned at him. “She’s always known her family was innocent,” she answered him coldly. “Which is why Darren murdering her nine-year-old sister was so much harder to bear.”
Her gaze then immediately turned back to me, a wrathful fire blazing behind them with so much heat I could feel it warming my skin.
So Katherine had finally found a single vertebra in her glass spine strong enough to reveal the bloodied past she wanted so desperately to change. For the first time ever, a tiny spark of admiration for her had flickered for just a single moment before I quickly snuffed it out.
“Children killing children,” Jaden continued, her voice hard with disdain. “What a world to be raised in.”
I smirked then, relishing the taste of her bait I rarely got to enjoy anymore.
“I was hardly a child then, Jaden,” I reminded her.
She scoffed at my dismissal. “Sixteen is still a child, Darren. Your brain wasn’t even fully developed yet,” she argued. “Which is why it was so easy for your father to mold your squishy little brain into the exact shape he wanted. And now look at you. Your mother died for nothing. She’d be so disappointed in both of you.”

“Shut the fuck up, you little shit!” Daniel scorned. “You have no idea what the fuck you’re talking about!”
I could feel my hands curling into tight fists as an inferno of fire rivaling a volcanic eruption burst through my veins.
“Daniel, get out,” I seethed, my eyes seeing nothing but red as I stared back at the gorgeous little demon I had created.
“Why? So you can coddle your bitch of a wife some more?” he retorted bitterly.
“I said get the fuck out!” I roared at him, ready to remove him in pieces if I had to.
Scott quickly stepped up and took Daniel roughly by the shoulders. “Come on, dude. It’s not worth it.”
Daniel growled a series of inaudible grumbles as he reluctantly went with Scott.
“You too, Sloane,” I added sharply. “And take Camaro with you.”
Sloane nodded and whistled for Camaro to follow her, a huffed groan leaving the dog’s mouth as they both turned to leave. When the doors slammed shut, I realized two showdowns with my wife in the last twenty minutes was a new record for us. And it made me want to fucking strangle her.
“What exactly did you think you were going to accomplish with that little stunt just now?”
She cocked a brow at my question. “You finally revealed your twisted little secret,” she answered bluntly. “I thought it was only fair for me to do the same.”
“That’s not what I asked you,” I replied sharply. “What were you hoping to achieve by revealing that letter? Fuck up my world? Is that what you thought you were doing?”
Jaden shook her head. “Sometimes all it takes is planting one little seed.
And it seems like it’s already taking effect. I can see it in your eyes.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?” I snarled, damn near ready to do something I might actually regret later.
Jaden stepped forward, dropping her arms to her sides, and glared up at me without fear.
“You seem to think that making me a mother to your children is a foolproof plan in ensuring I’ll never leave you. That I’ll stay for them. That I’ll learn to accept and return love, for them. But as you can see, your own mother has already obliterated that little theory into dust.”
I snatched her throat in my hand and ripped her toward me, squeezing just enough to bring that fear back into her pretty eyes.
“Three and a half years, Jaden,” I growled. “Three and a half years. That’s how long I’ve owned you. And you’ve waited until now to try to leverage that little piece of information? For what? Did you really think it was going to change my mind? That your duties as my wife would suddenly vanish?”
She huffed a humorous laugh. “Of course not. You’re too damn stubborn for that,” she rasped, her jagged voice vibrating against my palm.
“Then what, princess? What did you think revealing my mother’s insanity would prove? Other than the fact that you’re a conniving little brat bound for a world of misery in the next five minutes.”
She exhaled sharply through her nose, her eyes shadowed with the doubt she failed to conceal.
“You’re trying to achieve something by force under the false impression that I’ll change my mind and become more content with my life if you make me a mother,” she argued back, even as her jaw trembled against my hand. “But that’s not what’s going to happen. If anything, Darren, you’ll just make me more dangerous.”
I smirked at her little threat, somehow missing this kind of twisted psychological sparring only she and I could share. The turbulent delusions of her mind always had me intrigued.

“And how do you figure that?” I asked.
She paused for a moment as her hazel eyes swirled with a storm of chaos aimed directly at me.
“Because the most dangerous weapon on this planet isn’t nuclear power, armies, or even money, Darren,” she murmured softly, her gaze hardening with a ferocity I recognized as the threat it was meant to be. “It’s a mother’s love for her child. And you just handed it to me on a silver platter.”


To be continued in Part 2.

“What rules?” he looked at me as if he had no idea what I was talking about.
My eyes almost widened in panic. What if he forgot? Would he take back his word?
“You said I could go outside today while you’re gone,” I replied carefully.
He squinted his eyes for a second as if he were trying to remember and then his eyes finally lit up.
“Oh yes, that’s right. I did say that,” he said casually.

I breathed a sigh of relief … until he gave me that intense warning look again.
“You are to remain within the sights of the guards at all times. No going beyond the trees and no swimming beyond those buoys.” He pointed out to the water where five large orange buoys were floating about a hundred feet away from shore. “Your perimeter has been extended to my property line, but that does not mean you are to try and discover it. Stay within the limits I have given you, and eventually, you will be able to go beyond them.”
“Okay,” I said softly, my eyes staring right into his.
“Come here,” he said, holding his arms out.
I slowly stood and went to him. When I closed the distance, Darren wrapped his arms around me and pulled me against his chest in a tight embrace. He held me for a while, his nose in my hair as he took several slow, deep breaths as if he were breathing me in. I rested my cheek on his chest and listened to his heartbeat. It was strong, steady, and oddly calming to me as I focused on the tempo.
Moments like these confused me the most. For someone so strong and so cruel, I loved that he could be gentle with me and could just hold me like this. Moments like these told me I meant something to him. That I was more than just a tight fuck toy for him. And moments like these left me hungry for more.
After a short minute, Darren pushed me away from him by my shoulders and looked me straight in the eye.
“You will listen to the guards and obey the rules. If they tell you to refrain from doing something, you don’t fight or argue. You do what they say, when they say it because, believe it or not, it’s for your own protection, Jaden. They’re not here to just watch over you. They are here to protect you. Let them do their job.”
“Okay.” I nodded. He turned his head and gave me a warning look. “Yes, Darren,” I corrected myself.
He relaxed slightly.
“I know how much you wanted this, and now, I’m trusting you not to make me regret it. Do not disappoint me, Jaden, because if you do, this will not happen again for a very long time.”
Darren’s face was intense with warning, and I didn’t want to think about being shunned back into my room because I fucked this up with my

stubbornness. I needed to behave long enough for him to trust me.
“I’m not going to disappoint you, Darren,” I replied, sounding as serious as I possibly could. “I promise.”
“Good,” he said. He then leaned down, took my face in his hands, and kissed me softly on the mouth. His lips were gentle as they caressed mine, his tongue sliding in and claiming everything it touched. By the time he was done, I was breathless and disorientated, but I shook it off as he looked down at me and smiled. “I’ll see you at dinner,” he said, then kissed my forehead and walked back into the house, leaving me on the patio.
I sat back in my chair with a huff of relief and looked out to the ocean. So many new possibilities before me and I couldn’t wait to explore.







Chapter Thirty. New Boundaries.
After running upstairs to change into some workout clothes and wash my
makeup off, I practically skipped my happy ass all the way back to the patio. I decided I wanted to go for a run on the beach. But when I came back to the patio, there wasn’t just one guard standing there, there were three. They were big guys, too, not nearly as tall as Darren, but still much taller than I was. I eyed them carefully as I stepped around them, looking them up and down and noticing everything I could about them. None of them even looked at me.
“Uh … I’m gonna go for a run on the beach.” I pointed with my thumb over my shoulder.
One guard, the one in the middle, nodded slightly but still didn’t look at me. God, that wasn’t just annoying, it was plain fucking rude. I rolled my eyes at them, turned on my heels, and headed down to the shore as my excitement quickly returned.
When I got to the sand, I took my Nikes off and left them on the grass as I walked barefoot to the water. A sense of freedom calmed me as I stepped into the oncoming waves of the ocean, and it felt like bathwater against my skin. The perfect temperature.
I took one last look at the guards before sprinting off down the shore. I started with a slow, easy jog just to soak up the sun and breathe in the salty air. I must have run up and down the shore for an hour, turning around every fifteen minutes. I was afraid I might leave the sight of the guards and then I’d be in trouble.
The sun was blazing out, and eventually, sweat covered my body. I could’ve gone back inside and showered, but I wanted to do something fun instead. So I ran into the water and dived with my clothes on with not a single care in the world. When I surfaced, I floated on my back for a while, just taking in the soft blue sky and watching the seagulls fly above me. At that moment, I forgot everything around me. I forgot about Darren, about

his rules, about his name on my skin, and the cuffs around my body. I forgot about the pain, the grief, and the vengeance and I just … drifted. It was everything I needed as the clarity I had longed for finally came to me. But it wasn’t meant to last forever.
“Miss Jaden!” I heard someone shout my name. I immediately rose up from the water to address the voice, noticing it was a guard calling me from the beach. “It’s time to come in for lunch!” he called.
Lunch? Fuck lunch.
Except I promised Darren I would listen to the guards. I didn’t want to fuck this up, and I was actually a little hungry.
“Okay!” I shouted back to him as I made my way toward the shore. The guard stood there watching me and waited for me to walk to him.
He had a large beach towel in his hand, and he handed it to me when I reached him.
“Thank you,” I said, taking the towel and wrapping it around myself to dry off.
I grabbed my shoes that sat in the grass and the guard escorted me back to the table on the patio where my lunch was apparently waiting. I ate my lunch quietly, trying to ignore the guards as they stood around, staring off into the distance.
“So are you guys, like, my permanent outdoor babysitters or something?” I asked between bites. I probably shouldn’t have been talking to them, but … I was me.
None of them said a word—didn’t even look my way.
I nodded at their silence, not really offended but not really surprised. “Lucky you guys,” I said, taking another bite of my turkey sandwich.
When I was done with my lunch, I headed back into the house to wash the salt water from my hair and body. The guards remained where they were as I went back inside. After my shower, I redid my hair and makeup, put on another black skort and a hot pink t-shirt, and headed back outside in my Nikes. I was determined to spend the entire day under the sun if I could.
I walked along the gardens, ventured around the pool, and got a damn good idea of the size of the house and all its windows and accesses. Everywhere I went, a guard was not far from my sight, and they watched me like hawks. If I ventured too far into the trees, one of them would call out my name and wave me back. Begrudgingly, I listened to them like a

good little girl to show Darren I was serious about following his rules. I wanted to show him how grateful I was that he was finally letting me out of my cage a little bit.
When he came home that afternoon, he found me lying on the grass, my hands behind my head while I stared up at the clouds. I could hear him coming, sensing his presence even before he was near when suddenly his face came into focus and he beamed down at me.
“Hi, there.” He smiled.
“Hi.” I smiled back genuinely, remaining in my position as I looked up at him. I was too happy being outside to let him sour my mood with his presence.
“How was your day?” he asked curiously.
“Fantastic,” I replied. “Yours?”
“Equally fantastic.”
“I doubt that.” I smiled with amusement.
“What are you doing down there?”
“Trying to determine if that cloud looks more like a rabbit or a wolf.” I pointed up at the sky to the cloud I was mentioning.
“Hmm … I don’t know,” Darren said as he laid down on the grass beside me. I was shocked that he was joining me. I would have thought he might have been afraid he’d ruin his suit. “I don’t think those ears are short enough to be a wolf,” he said, as he folded his hands behind his head as I had mine. I turned my gaze back to the sky.
“But the tail is too long to be a rabbit,” I said.
“Maybe, but the body is kind of small, similar to how a rabbit sits.”
“True, but the wolf could also be laying down on its side.”
“I’m taking it you’re leaning more toward the cloud being a wolf,” Darren stated.
I shrugged. “I like wolves.”
“Well, how fortunate,” Darren declared as he rolled over onto his side, propping his head up on his elbow and giving me a devilish smile. “Because I like rabbits.”
And then, in a flash, he was on top of me; he was kissing me all over my face, my neck, my shoulder, all the while tickling the shit out of my sides and stomach. “I like to hunt them and eat them for dinner.” He chuckled against my skin as he furiously began to tickle me into oblivion.

I screamed in shock and squirmed under him, laughing loudly and uncontrollably as I fought to push his hands away.
“Ah! No, no, no, no! Stop it! Stop it!” I laughed as I squeezed my elbows into my sides to block his strong fingers from my skin. “Darren, stop it!”
His laugh was genuine and carefree as he continued to tickle me in the grass. “Stop?” He chuckled. “I don’t think so.”
And then his lips went back to my neck; I crunched my face to the side to try to block his advance, but his fingers kept my body twitching and jerking under him uncontrollably. I was somehow finally able to grab his fingers; I locked them in my hands and finally pushed him away, but he just rolled us so I ended up straddling him. I looked deep into his smiling face as I came down from my laughter only to realize my position.
I stared into the deep dark blue of his eyes and lost myself for a moment. I could feel Darren staring up at me, and at that moment, I had a feeling he was currently swimming in the amber of mine. God, he was so beautiful, his face carved like that of an angel, but he had the soul of a demon and that made him the ugliest human on Earth.
I could feel my happy mood begin to fade away as I realized I had been laughing with Darren like I was happy, like everything was okay, but it wasn’t. This wasn’t supposed to be, but when I heard the sound of his honest laughter, it did something to me. It wasn’t the normal evil chuckle he administered; no, this one was relaxed and light. It was the sound of his joy
… and it was with me.
“God, that sound,” he said, his thumb coming up to rub along my cheek. “I’ve never heard anything so satisfying in all my life.”
“What sound?” I asked.
“Your laughter. I don’t think I’ve ever heard it like that before.”
My face went blank. Fuck, he’d nearly been thinking the same thing.
“Sorry to disappoint, but I haven’t had much reason to laugh lately,” I said carefully.
“I know,” he said in understanding. “But if you let me, I can easily change that.”
I didn’t know how he thought he could. He really expected me to relinquish my freedom to him and just accept the life he was “giving” me, even if it was completely incompatible with who I was as a person. In no

way could a woman like me ever be happy with a man like him. If you could even call him a man.
“I’m just not sure you can,” I said softly. I didn’t know why I told him that, but it seemed like there was a lot of honesty going on.
“You don’t think I can, or you don’t want me to?” he asked, a challenging look in his eye.
Did I want him to make me happy? Did I want him to be the source of my laughter and smiles? No, of course not. Darren was not what I wanted out of life because he came with chains that controlled and hurt. Who would want a man like that? Sure, many women were turned on by an alpha male, myself included, but Darren wasn’t just an alpha. He was my fucking warden, my tyrant, my captor, and I hated him for it. But it didn’t matter whether I wanted him to be the source of my happiness because the only thing I would ever feel when it came to him was misery. I highly doubted anything could change that.
I suddenly noticed the position I was in as I straddled Darren, distress beginning to shadow me as I remembered the last time I had straddled him like this. Things hadn’t gone so well for me then. I pursed my lips and moved to get off him, but he grabbed my hips and held me fast.
“No, don’t run,” he said seriously.
“I’m not running, but the last time I straddled you like this, things did not end well,” I told him honestly.
“Then don’t misbehave this time and they won’t,” he replied matter- of-factly. “Now, answer my question.”
“I don’t want to cause a fight.”
“Then answer my question and you won’t,” he said, that warning glare arising again.
“I …” I started to answer but was too afraid to finish. I really didn’t want to end up back in my cage for angering him with my opinion.
I looked down at him with a blank face, though I was sure he could feel the sadness that clouded my eyes like a rainstorm. My eyes fell to his chest, taking in the dark gray tie that rested over his light gray dress shirt and suit jacket. As if noticing my distraction, Darren took one of my wrists in his hand and brought it to his lips. His nose tickled up the soft skin of my wrist, tracing my tattoo before kissing it gently over and over again.
“You don’t have to be so scared all the time, Jaden,” he said softly, keeping his eyes on my wrist. “I won’t deliberately hurt you unless you give

me a reason to.”
“Yet you somehow always manage to get me to give you a reason,” I replied with caution.
“Yes, you do have a very sensitive fuse that’s easy to light.” He smirked at me between kisses.
“No more sensitive than yours.” I glared back.
“Yes.” He almost laughed. “But mine is the one you need to avoid.”
“Yet mine is the one you love to light.” I smirked back like the cocky little shit I was.
He chuckled at me then as his eyes roamed over my body. And then, before I could blink, he rolled us over and I was back on my back, Darren now nestled between my legs while his hands rested on the grass at my sides. There was that gorgeous smile again. God, it made me liquefy inside when I saw it. This was his warm smile, the one that told me I was safe from the monster inside him so long as I didn’t feed it.
His lips found the underside of my jaw and they made a sweet little trail up to my ear. “Stop dodging,” he said softly. “Answer my question.”
I sighed, hoping he would concentrate on something else other than the thing I knew would ruin both our moods.
“Look at me,” I said carefully. Darren brought his eyes up to face mine, but there was a dangerous look to them. Yeah, yeah, I told you to do something. Get over it. “And I mean really look at me, Darren. Have you ever seen a wild lion at the zoo? One that didn’t grow up in captivity?”
Darren’s face remained blank as he stared down at me, but I could tell he was listening intently.
“You ever see the fire they once had in their eyes disappear when they remember how they used to roam free in the wild? Hunting and running as they pleased only to be locked away in a small, barely recognizable habitat for them to spend the rest of their tormented lives in? You see how that fire dies? That’s me. And that’ll be me for the rest of my life if you continue to keep me like this. So do I think you can make me happy? I’m sorry, but you have to understand my sincere skepticism.”
Instead of the intense glare I had expected to get, I received the most smart-ass smirk I’d ever seen.
“Sounds like a challenge to me.” He grinned.
I shook my head, disappointed with his answer. Of course, everything was a challenge to him.

“You’re not listening to me. I’m just a conquest for you. I know I’m the only one who’s ever stood up to you, and I know that’s what drew you in. But what happens if that day comes, when I’ve finally had enough, when I’ve finally given up and I become dull and robotically obedient? You will get bored of me and will eventually want someone else. Probably someone younger. I’m just a phase for you, and when you’ve finally won, you’ll move on to the next challenge.”
Wow, I couldn’t believe I said that, but sometimes my mouth just runs with whatever’s on my mind. I had to learn to curb that shit.
Darren looked down at me with a blank face, but his eyes said something totally different. Anger. I quickly backtracked.
“I’m sorry,” I said anxiously. “I shouldn’t have said all that.”
His eyes narrowed, and I felt chills rise up my spine. Fuck, I knew it.
“Don’t apologize for something you’re not actually sorry for. The only reason you’re sorry is for yourself because you know you’re in trouble,” he said in anger.
“You’re right, I’m sorry,” I apologized quickly. “I didn’t mean to analyze. I am a psychology major, after all.”
“You’re also very wrong,” he replied darkly.
I looked at him to clarify, but he just shook his head at me in disappointment.
“Do you have no faith in yourself, Jaden?” he asked me softly. I squinted at him curiously. “Do you really think I will break you down so badly that you’ll just retreat to something robotic and routine? No,” he said, shaking his head. “There are stages to this, Jaden, many stages. The road to perfection will be long and hard, but I know we can get there.”
“And where does that road lead?” I asked.
“Our happiness,” he said softly with a genuine smile.
Our happiness …
I slowly shook my head at him in disbelief.
So delusional …
“I know you don’t believe me now,” he said, tucking a strand of my hair behind my ear. “But things will get easier. I promise. You have to trust me.”



will.”
“But,” I started, afraid to finish my sentence. “I don’t want this.”
“Not yet,” he said simply, tracing his thumb along my jaw. “But you

Darren then made a move to prove his point and fucked me in the grass. But it wasn’t his usual routine because it was more as if he was making love to me than anything else. He was slow and gentle, taking his time with my body, feeling and kissing every inch until I found myself moaning for more. I was worried about the guards seeing us at first, but Darren assured me his guards knew better than to watch. I was grateful because the things we did in that grass were things I wasn’t about to forget anytime soon.
I spent the rest of the night thinking about Darren and what he had said to me. I had challenged him again, but this time, it was for something that might actually benefit me. If he could try to just be a little nicer, a little less demanding, things might be a little more tolerable, but it would never stop me from wanting to escape him. I didn’t think that urge would ever fade. He thought I’d eventually give in and come around, wanting him over my freedom, but he was so wrong … because I wanted someone else far more than he could ever comprehend. My loyalty would never belong to him … because it still belonged to someone else.







Chapter Thirty-One. Discovery.
The following week had been better. Now that I was able to go outside, my
mood was better, and Darren seemed to respond better to me now that I wasn’t sulking or arguing as much. I hadn’t seen him as much as he was working a lot, but he still tried to make sure he, at least, had dinner with me.
True to his word, Darren had started to lighten up. He was softer and less aggressive with me, but he was still just as demanding; I didn’t think that would ever change. I didn’t think he knew how not to be demanding since he was so used to always getting his way, but it was nice that he was trying to make me less miserable in his presence.
Our conversations were beginning to change. I worked hard to make sure I didn’t bring up a single topic that would start a fight, but I seriously had to hold my tongue at times when a certain opinion of his came out of his mouth. But it was when Darren brought up the potential future that I had a hard time not shutting down. He could tell when it upset me, and I knew it was upsetting him that it upset me, but I could see some times when he himself was actually holding back to avoid a fight. Maybe he, too, was trying to keep the peace no matter how temporary it was.
Darren still refused to discuss any of his personal business with me, but I wanted to know more about his dealings so I would know who to watch out for when my plan to escape came to life. I tried to pay attention to his phone calls and conversations with guards and associates. Words like Triguard, Audeāmus, countermeasures and strikes, shipments, and auction. Anytime I heard anything remotely close to mentioning the warehouse, my stomach would backflip. And it only motivated me to start paying attention to names—Ron, Matt, Carlos, Moross, Dan, Dominic, and Ray. My hit list was getting bigger by the day.
The days Darren worked from home were strange. Everyone seemed anxious and on their toes while people I’d never seen before came and went from his office. Darren’s guards would often usher me away from his office,

telling me Darren was busy and not to disturb him. But I wasn’t interested in him; I was interested in the people he dealt with on a regular basis.
Every now and then, I would continue to see the gardener here and there, and one time, I just flat out waved to him with a fake-ass happy smile on my face, hoping he would see that I was fine. He gave me a small short wave back and returned to his work.
One morning, Darren and I talked about our general interests and found common ground. He still liked to pry me on things about my childhood, and it usually brought a smile to his face, so I obliged.
“You’re going to think this is hilarious.” I chuckled. “But I used to love flying kites when I was a kid.”
“Really?” Darren asked enthusiastically, obviously thinking it was hilarious.
“Oh yeah, and I was really good at it, too. I could always catch the perfect breeze and make it fly for hours. I could even do tricks and make it spin around like a bird. I kind of miss it, actually. It was very relaxing.”
Darren just gave me a knowing smile as if he was up to something.
He usually always was.
The following morning, Darren had told me he would be late coming home and that I would be having dinner alone. Shocker there, but he suddenly said that he had a surprise for me. He stood up from the chair and went to pull the other chair out that sat across the table from me. He then pulled up a long wrapped present and set it down in front of me. It was wrapped in white wrapping paper with a bright pink bow. I gave Darren a look, but he just urged me to open it. After ripping off the paper and bow, I pulled the top off the rectangular box and pushed back the white tissue paper to find what looked like some dark purple fabric, thin plastic poles, and string. I looked at it curiously before I pulled the fabric out and realized it was the makings of a kite!
“Ha!” I laughed.
I pulled everything out with pure excitement on my face and immediately put the kite together. When I looked back up at Darren with a huge smile on my face, that warm sexy one of his smiled back.
“Thank you,” I said earnestly.
“You’re welcome,” he replied, his eyes soft as he watched me. “Maybe you can show me some of your tricks when I get back.” He winked.

“Be ready to have your mind blown.” I grinned.
I gave Darren a very nice good-bye kiss before he left, and then I spent the remainder of my day outside. I smiled to myself as I hooked the kite to my string and let it take off into the wind, but it wouldn’t stay in flight for long. The wind wasn’t strong enough to keep it up. I would have to wait until after dinner to try again.
Getting Darren to buy me the kite had been easier than I thought. Sure, I loved it when I was a kid, but I couldn’t give a fuck less about flying it now. I just needed a good excuse to climb one of these fucking trees to figure out where the fuck I was. And here I thought Darren knew when he was being manipulated. Stupid, cocky fuck.
I had dinner later alone on the patio and afterward casually strolled by the edge of the trees while flying my kite. The wind had picked up as I had hoped. Luckily, it was also pointing just in the right direction. I sporadically glanced around here and there, but I could no longer see the guards who normally watched me. After a while, they had spread out from the patio as they had more than just me to watch over. When I couldn’t see anyone for the next several minutes, I purposefully tripped over myself and let go of the handle holding on to my kite. Like a man on a mission, the kite aggressively flew away and landed in one of the branches atop a large, tall tree. Absolute perfection.
I glanced around one last time to make sure no one was watching and quickly started to climb the tree, flats and dress be damned. Truth be told, I was terrified of heights, but I didn't let that stop me as I climbed higher and higher until I finally reached the top and grabbed the stupid kite, securing it in my hand.
I then eagerly looked out from the tree and realized I could see Darren’s entire estate from up here. It was a lot bigger than I had thought. I couldn’t see his property line as trees surrounded the estate, but from what I could tell, Darren probably had forty or fifty acres of private land. I could see the gate to the entrance of the estate and it looked like it might have wrapped all the way around the property. There were no neighbors, and I could see the private paved road that led to the gate.
Adrenaline began to rush through me as I frantically looked off into the far distance, taking everything in, looking for anything that might give away my location. But as I looked off into the distance, miles away there were buildings, and structures, and hills. I could see a city, but I knew it was

probably about twenty miles away. And then I saw a bridge; a bridge way off in the distance, but one I instantly recognized. The Coronado Bridge in San Diego, California.
My heart leaped with joy as my earlier suspicions were correct and then sank to the bottom of my soul as I realized how far away from home I was. I was all the way on the other side of the fucking country.
How the fuck had I gotten this far without noticing? There was no way I had gotten here without being flown this far, but I don’t recall ever getting on a plane. Had I been drugged that heavily? They had to have a private jet and landing strip to be able to get away with it. So many fucking questions spinning around in my head.
Looking over at the horizon, I couldn’t help but appreciate the view of the water. I could see sailboats and freighters floating along toward the city, and I suddenly longed to be free like that. I could have stayed up in that tree forever, but I knew that eventually I would have to come down. But things abruptly took a turn for the worst as I heard Darren’s loud, angry voice call out my name and I hunched in the tree from shock and fear. In a panic, I frantically started to climb down with the kite as quickly as I possibly could. He’d kill me if he found me up here.
Just as I leaned forward to climb down the next branch, I felt my cuffs link together and I completely lost my footing. I screamed as my stomach dropped to my feet while I began to fall heavily down through the branches, tearing my dress, and scratching up my arms and legs as the limbs of the tree broke against my body.
Fear consumed me as I thought I would tumble down to my death, but luckily, I caught a branch with my arms halfway down. It scratched and tore my skin, but I clung to it tightly as I tried to catch my breath and calm my shaking nerves, pain now enveloping my entire body. It didn’t help much when I looked down to find Darren standing underneath the tree. I couldn’t see his face very well, but I knew he was pissed.
“Jaden!” he yelled at me. “What the FUCK are you doing up there?!” Yeah, he was furious.
“Let me go so I can climb down!” I shouted back to him. There was no way I could successfully climb down with my limbs bound like this.
After a few seconds, I felt the force binding my cuffs diminish, and I held on for only a second longer before climbing down to meet my death. I

had lost the kite somewhere among the branches, but there was no point in going for it now.
I jumped down from the last branch and stared up at a very sinister looking Darren and took a slight step back. Faster than I had anticipated, he grabbed my throat and shoved me up against the tree roughly.
“Just what the fuck were you doing up there, huh? And who the fuck told you that you could roam around out here?” he roared down at me.
“I’m sorry! My kite got stuck in the tree! I just climbed up to get it. I didn’t think it was a big deal,” I struggled to say as my hands grabbed his wrist that held me in place. My blood was racing, my heart was pounding out of my chest, and I could feel the heat begin to blossom between my legs. What the fuck was wrong with me?
“So you decided to risk your safety over a fucking kite?” His voice was all malice and venom as it pierced through my ears, further driving my fear.


back.
“It’s just a fucking tree! I used to climb them all the time,” I shot

“Watch it, little girl,” he warned, glaring at me. “Your safety is of

more concern to me than your childhood activities. Apparently, I need to rearrange your priorities.” He squeezed harder, causing tears to form in the corner of my eyes.
“I’m sorry. It was stupid,” I groaned against his strength.
“Yes, it was very stupid! Do you have any idea how dangerous that was? What if you had fallen and broken something?”
“Well, I was doing just fine until someone decided to bind me up,” I retorted.
“And you wouldn’t have fallen had you not been up there in the first place!” He was yelling now, and I flinched back in my skin and looked away from him.
“You're right. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.”
“You're goddamn right it won’t,” he snarled and flipped me around, shoving my dress up all the way to the back of my neck.
Taking off his belt, he whipped me hard fifteen times over my back and ass until there was nothing but thick red marks left behind. As if I wasn’t sore enough from halfway falling out of a tree. When he was finished, my face was red as silent tears fell down my face. Darren then dragged me back into the house by my hair. And that was when I noticed

the gardener standing at the side of the house, concern and anger clear as day across his face. Shit. Major bad timing.
My entire backside ached and burned the rest of the day and well into the morning, the need between my legs long forgotten after Darren finished fucking me from behind in his bed. He didn't give a single fuck even when he tucked me against his side that night. He said if I hadn't been so stupid and careless, I wouldn't be in so much pain.
Of course, my punishments were always my fault, and I spent most of that night unable to sleep from tears and pain. But I reminded myself it wasn’t all for naught. I finally knew where I was and had a better understanding of the property I was a prisoner of. Tomorrow, I would start the new phase of my plan of escape.







Chapter Thirty-Two. Trouble.


When I woke up in the morning, I looked down to find Jaden’s sleeping form and couldn’t help but smile. She had rolled over in the night, resting her head on my shoulder as she slept. It honestly amazed me how she could so quickly fill me with murderous rage and then melt my black heart the next.
I had given her so much in the last month, more than I was ready to, but I had already compared Jaden to the lion in the zoo long before she ever told me about it … because that was exactly what I was afraid of. All I wanted was for Jaden to know her place—to respect and obey me without question, surrender all of her passion to me, and laugh with me like she was happy. But I couldn’t force her to be happy. What I could do was everything in my power to make her happy, yet understand that it would never be enough. I just hoped she didn’t end up like the lion in the zoo.
She would never be happy with me as long as she had something else to hold on to. I could see that she was trying to make me happy, but it was for her own self-interests and benefits. She knew what she needed to do to make things easier for herself, but the simple fact was she hated it. Jaden hated bowing down to me, but it was something she was going to have to get used to, and eventually, she would. She’d only been with me barely a short couple of months, but already there was so much improvement and so much potential.
I looked down at Jaden, feeling her soft skin beneath my fingertips. She flinched a little in her sleep when my hand grazed down her back, still sore from my belt yesterday. I couldn’t be surprised that she had climbed the tree to retrieve her kite; she’d probably done it all the time before me because she was fearless—another trait I loved about her. It wasn’t as if I didn’t think she was capable or coordinated enough to climb a damn tree,

but the simple truth was it was still dangerous, and anything that threatened her safety had me raging inside.
Daniel had fallen out of one of those trees a long time ago when we were young boys. He’d broken his arm then and our father had been furious, just as I was now. I had reprimanded the guards watching her and made sure they knew Jaden was never to climb another fucking tree again.
The sun started to shine through the windows and the light poured over Jaden’s hair, igniting the beautiful reds and coppers that reminded me of fire. The fire I loved so much.
Eventually and reluctantly, I rolled out of bed, careful not to disturb her, and headed downstairs for my workout. After a good run and warm-up, I sparred with Scott for a while in the octagon; he and I were too equally matched for one of us to actually surrender. We would eventually just tire each other out.
Two hours later, I went back upstairs to find Jaden still sleeping in my bed. I took a quick shower and got dressed, Jaden now finally waking up by the time I was done. She stretched her naked body as I fastened my black chrome Rolex around my wrist, her slight wincing hard to ignore.
“Good morning,” I said to her as I went to put on my jacket. “Morning,” she said quietly, looking away. I hated when I couldn’t
see her eyes.
And then my phone started to ring. I pulled it from my pants pocket and answered, walking away toward my closet and out of Jaden’s earshot. I noticed she had been trying to listen in on some of my conversations lately. She thought she was sneaky, but she couldn’t hide much from me.
“Yeah?” I said into the phone.
“Darren, it’s Hagen. We’ve got a bit of a situation you’re going to want to handle personally. We’re on our way over to you now.”
I pinched the bridge of my nose. It was too early for this shit already.
“What’s the situation?” I asked.
“It’s about your girl.”
My head perked up. Well, now he had my attention.
“What’s your ETA?”
“Five minutes.”
I hung up the phone and headed out into my room. Jaden was still sitting on the bed, staring out the window.
“Go get dressed.” I pointed at her as I headed for the door.

She gave me a strange look but didn’t argue as I left the room, closing the door behind me. I didn’t have time to deal with her questions; if something was up concerning her, then I needed to know right fucking now. I gathered Scott and together, he and I and two other guards made our way out to the front of the house. Hagen was just pulling up in his sheriff’s vehicle.
He stepped out, nodding in my direction as he began to head toward me while his men pulled a man from the backseat. They dragged him over to where we stood and dropped him to his knees in front of me. I looked down at the man and instantly recognized him. He was one of the gardeners I’d hired to care for the grounds of my estate. The fuck was this shit?
“What the fuck is this?” I waved at the man as I looked at Hagen.
“Well, you see, this gentleman right here claims you’ve got a girl locked up in your house who’s been missing for months. Says you abuse her and won’t let her leave,” Hagen said casually.
If I hadn’t been so pissed off, I would have started laughing.
“Is that so?” I said, looking down at the man who now cowered in fear. “And what evidence does he have to support this wild claim?”
“Says he’s seen her several times on the news and recognized her. Says he knows she doesn’t want to be here and that she’s in trouble. He wanted to help her.”
I felt my shoulders bulge with pure rage as I looked down at the puny fuck who actually attempted to have Jaden taken away from me. And what’s more, she probably played a part in this. She probably fucking begged him to.
“Please, señor,” the man began to plead in a heavy Spanish accent while his hands remained cuffed behind his back. “Please, it’s misunderstanding. I-I’m sorry. Please, I have family.”
I just glared at him, unconsciously baring my teeth while I thought about ripping his throat out, but I had to confirm something first.
“Get Jaden, now,” I told Eric, one of my guards, and returned my attention to Hagen. “Has this fucker told anyone else about this?” I asked Hagen.
“Doesn’t seem that way. Otherwise, I’d have a lot more phone calls to answer this morning.”
“Clean it up if you do. I don’t need anyone else snooping into my business.”

“Will do.” Hagen nodded.
I heard the front door open and the sound of struggling caught my ears. I turned to find Eric dragging Jaden by her upper arm as she fought to keep up with him in her little flats. When they reached us, she yanked her arm out of Eric’s grasp and turned to me.
“What is this? What’s going on?” she asked me with a much harsher tone than she should have.
“Do you know this man?” I asked sharply, pointing at the gardener who began to shake uncontrollably.
She looked down and her eyes lit up with fear, shock, and recognition. Oh yeah, she knew him. She knew him far more than she should.
“No, I don’t know him,” she said with an attitude. “Why would I know him? You don’t let me talk to anyone.”
“Well, he certainly thinks he knows you. In fact, he knows you so well that he seems to think you’re a missing person,” I said very lightly.
“Well, I can imagine why he would think that,” she replied.
Without even thinking, I grabbed her throat and roughly pulled her to me. Her little hands wrapped around my wrist as she fought for balance and ground. “This stupid fuck decided to take it upon himself to report you to the police.” I watched her for a minute to see how she reacted. “But for all I know, you could have told him to go to the police for you. Is that what you did, Jaden? Begged this man to help you escape?” I practically roared at her. Her eyes lit up in panic.
“No! No! I swear I didn’t do anything!” she pleaded back. “Why would I even bother to tell him that when I know the police can’t help me?” “I don’t know, Jaden, someone obviously put the idea in his head,” I
growled menacingly.
“I swear I’ve never spoken a word to him!”
“You expect me to believe that?” I snarled. I was so close to snapping, it almost felt inevitable.
“Yes! I swear to you I never asked him to do anything. Please, Darren, don’t hurt him. He didn’t understand what he was doing.”
“Oh, no. This little fuck knew exactly what he was doing. He was trying to take you away from me, and that, princess, simply will not do.”
I released Jaden’s throat, watching as she stumbled back only a little before Scott caught her shoulders and forced her to still. I then hauled

around and kicked the stupid Mexican fuck right in the face.
“No!” Jaden screamed behind me. “Darren, stop it!” I sensed the lunge of her body as she moved to stop me, but I ignored her, knowing full well Scott could handle her.
The gardener fell back with a grunt as I got on top of him and started pummeling his face with my fists. Fury flowed through my blood as I released my rage onto the guy’s flesh. Just who the fuck did he think he was? Her savior? I didn’t fucking think so.
Jaden continued to yell and cuss as she began to fight with Scott to get at me, but he was steadfast. I punched the guy several more times, shattering his nose and cheekbones before standing up and addressing my guards.
“Kill his family. And bring him to the shed.”
“What?! No!” Jaden screamed and fought harder with Scott. “You can’t fucking do that, Darren. They’re innocent!”
“And you,” I roared as I grabbed her throat a second time and began dragging her backward with me to the shed. I was so pissed; I could have snapped her in half with ease. “You can kiss your family good-bye.”







Chapter Thirty-Three. Torture.
“What?! Darren, no! Please, listen to me!” I screamed in absolute shock
and panic. “I had nothing to do with-”
“Shut up,” Darren cut me off, his voice low and dangerous. “I’ve heard enough.”
“No! Just listen to me for one sec-”
Darren yanked me to him by my throat as he squeezed tighter than ever, practically lifting me off the ground. “If I hear one more fucking word come out of your mouth …” He didn’t have to finish his threat, just glared at me with the promise of something even more horrible than what I was already going to experience. I gulped back my tears and just lowered my watery eyes to the ground. “Now move,” he ordered.
He turned me around and led me down toward the back of the house by the nape of my neck. His men followed, carting the poor gardener as he yelled and pleaded in Spanish. Terror consumed my entire being as I shook from head to toe, chills running up my spine with goosebumps forming along my arms. I didn’t say another word, fear controlling my every move now, though, I wanted to continue my protest. Something very bad was about to happen, and I had a strong feeling I was going to be a part of it.
Eventually, we made our way through the trees and came to a rather large looking shed like structure. Darren punched in a code that was to the right of the door, but the bulk of his body blocked my vision from catching it. When he pushed the door open, he pulled me inside while the miserable party behind us followed.
The room around me was dim with only a few ceiling lights to reveal the area. Concrete walls surrounded us with a dirty cement floor beneath my feet. Darren then pulled me over to the side of the room, which almost resembled a single car garage, but when he reached down to the floor, he lifted up a secret door hidden under the cement.

The two cops pulled the gardener down the steps while he struggled with every step. The man with the sheriff’s badge joined them, followed by Scott, Darren, and me, and Darren’s guards in tow. The stairs were long and curved until we came to the bottom of what looked like an unfinished basement. More cinderblock walls, except for a white tiled wall in the corner of the room, dimly lit ceilings, and cemented floors with a drain in the middle of it. My stomach coiled as I realized there were chains hanging from the ceiling and hooks on the walls. There was also a large iron door in the middle of the wall, but I could not tell where it led.
Two chairs were placed about ten feet apart, and a metal table of various instruments I couldn’t fully make out was set up beside the chair in the middle of the room. The chairs were not the same as the other. One was metal with rusted, dirty arms while the other looked more like a damn La- Z-Boy.
The cops practically threw the gardener onto the metal chair and immediately tied his hands and ankles to the frame of the chair. Darren still had me by my neck as he headed toward the other chair and nearly shoved me to the floor in front of it. He sat down and pulled me by my hair to perfectly position me on the floor between his legs.
I was going out of my mind with panic as tremors continued to hold my body prisoner, chills crawling up my skin. I quickly pulled my knees to my chest, wrapping my arms around my legs securely. Darren held my hair in a tight grip to keep my head up to the horrible scene before me. When the cops finished securing the gardener to the chair, they stepped back and Darren’s guards headed toward him, sick and twisted glints in their eyes.
“You need anything else?” the sheriff asked from behind us.
“No, I’ll take it from here. Thank you, Hagen,” Darren replied without taking his eyes off the gardener.
“Have fun,” the sheriff said with sick enthusiasm and then headed back upstairs with his deputies. Scott remained in the corner of the room with his arms crossed as he stared ahead of us.
The room was silent except for the quiet cries of the gardener as tears began to spill from his eyes. His chest shook and his breaths came out in heavy gasps as he looked out to Darren, pleading for mercy with his eyes.
“Please, señor,” he cried. “Please, have mercy. Please …”
“You should have thought of that before you decided to meddle in my business and try to fuck with what’s mine,” Darren said with nothing but

pure hatred.
And then he nodded at his men.
Without a single word of verbal command, the two guards began to haul their fists into the gardener’s body. I cringed into myself, my stomach sick with fear and guilt as I watched Darren’s guards beat the shit out of this poor man who only wanted to help me. The gardener grunted and cried, pleading in Spanish, but his words went unheard. Eventually, the guards rested their knuckles and went for something more drastic and gruesome. They began to break his fingers with a hammer.
I instantly hid my face into the side of Darren’s leg while my arms curled around his calf, clutching him tightly as the sound of the hammer on bone jerked me into a tight cringe. I kept my eyes in the general direction of the gardener but winced my eyes shut. Unfortunately, nothing could hide the blood-curdling screams of the poor man.
For the next longest six minutes of my life, I listened to Darren’s men break every one of the gardeners fingers, the sound of the hammer coming down enough to nearly make me vomit all over the floor. I kept it down, thankful to have not yet had my breakfast. I shook uncontrollably, my tears soaking Darren’s dress pants as I clung to him. He didn’t seem to mind, as he was too entranced by the gruesome scene he controlled before us. I didn’t even want to look at his face, knowing the sick and twisted smile I would find across his lips if I turned around.
When they finished breaking his fingers, I couldn’t withhold my voice anymore as I watched one of the guards pick up a power drill from the tray, a cruel and sadistic smile on his face.
I couldn’t take another second of this.
“Darren, please stop this! Please!” I screamed, turning around to face him, tears in my eyes, but all I was met with was a quick backhand to the face. My body jerked back in response as my face lit up with heat and pain. I brought my cold palm up to cool the side of my face as Darren yanked me to him by my hair. Out of total fear, I shrunk into myself and winced my eyes shut, too terrified to face him.
“Look at me,” he snarled. I tentatively opened my eyes; my hands clutched into fists at my chest, and cringed even more as the dark evil blue of his eyes swallowed me whole. “What the fuck did I tell you?” he roared at me.
“P-please, Darren,” I replied softly. “Please, I can’t watch anymore.”

He looked down at me and glared without a single hint of compassion in his eyes.
“At this point, Jaden, I couldn’t give a fuck less about what you want. Beginning today, I start hunting down your entire family, and I won’t stop until there’s nothing left of them and nothing left of your old life for you to hold on to. This idea of escape ends here and now. Now, shut your fucking mouth and watch the misery you’ve created because you thought you might have a chance to get away from me.”
He released my hair with a shove, and my mind officially went numb. I was in shock, yet I was in denial of what he actually said. I felt my heart race as my breathing pattern increased, panic rising in my blood while tears pooled at the corner of my eyes.
Darren was going to kill my entire family.
My horror mixed with the screams of my rescue victim was enough to completely send me over the edge. I felt my lips curl up in a snarl, exposing my teeth as I thought about Darren murdering my family. I shook with rage, the screams of the gardener ringing through my ears, and finally, I just … lost it.
I lunged at Darren from the floor, screaming like an absolute animal as the force of my advance caused the chair he sat in to flip backward. Darren and I crashed on the floor while I rained fists and elbows down on his face.
“I’ll fucking kill you!” I screamed in total fury. “I swear to God, I
will!”
I only got in a few hits before Darren threw me off him, but he didn’t
throw me far. He kept a strong grip on my dress before quickly righting himself, gripping the collar of my dress with both hands, and yanked me under him with such force the fabric ripped. Terror filled me, but I continued to fight. I wasn’t backing down. Not after a threat like that.
I managed to get one more good elbow jab across his face, but it didn’t even faze him. Instead, the growl that manifested itself accompanied by the intense glare of Darren’s eyes made me feel like my entire world was about to end. He didn’t even hold back this time. He straight up close-fist punched me right in the face and that was it. Lights out.



I stood over Jaden’s unconscious body, my chest heaving up and down with rage as I fought to control myself. I had lost it, completely fucking lost it, and silenced Jaden’s defiance in a way I never thought I would. I knew I would probably regret it in the morning, but I was too pissed to give a shit at the moment.
The buzz of the drill silenced while the pleas and cries of the stupid fucking gardener continued and I couldn’t stand the pathetic sound of it anymore. I grabbed one of the throwing knives I kept in my jacket, turned, and swiftly threw it right into the gardener’s jugular. I would have shot him, but the sound of the gun without a silencer would have shattered everyone’s ears. His screams instantly turned to gurgling as he began to choke on his own blood. I watched as the light faded from his eyes, satisfaction filling my soul knowing the meddling piece of shit was dead.
“Clean him up,” I ordered my men as I reached down and lifted Jaden.
I threw her over my shoulder and headed out of the basement shed. I took her back into the house and down to the black room where she would remain for the rest of the day. Placing her in her cage, I made sure the side of her now bruising face laid on the cold floor of the cage in hopes of bringing down the swelling by the time she woke up. Locking the door of the cage, I stepped back to admire my beautiful girl as she slept away her pain.
Now that I had calmed down, I felt like an asshole for hitting her like that. I had warned her so long ago that if she didn’t listen to me, I could snap and then I’d really hurt her. Today was exactly what I meant. I guess I couldn’t really blame her for attacking me like that; I had just told her I was going to kill her entire family. I probably would have done the same thing. The problem was she should have known better. She should have known she wasn’t going to win against me, yet she went after me anyway like the stubborn little girl she was.
My poor little Jaden. So much fury in such a tiny body. She probably wouldn’t speak to me after this for a while, which was probably a good thing. Nothing good ever came out of her mouth anyway, unless it was my dick.
I pulled out my phone and dialed Scott, whom I had left with my guards to help clean up the gardener and ensure my orders for the miserable fuck’s pathetic little family were carried out.

“Yeah,” he answered on the first ring.
“Meet me in my office,” I said, heading for the stairs and hung up. Time to start making preparations for Jaden’s family.







Chapter Thirty-Four. Deal.
I woke up shivering with a massive headache and a dull pain throbbing in
my cheek. I opened my swollen eyelids to find myself surrounded by darkness, but I knew where I was. I was back in my cage.
I curled into myself, wrapping my arms around my legs as I began to shed the necessary tears over today’s events. That was the most gruesome and traumatic thing I had ever witnessed. I wasn’t completely sensitive to blood and gore. After working at a personal injury law firm for so long, I had seen some pretty disgusting autopsy photos and injuries, but nothing compared to this. I could still hear the gardener’s screams echoing in my ears. It was as if I was back there, in the basement, watching him suffer because of me. I cried harder then, my body shaking with grief and guilt as I blamed myself for the horror of that poor man’s final moments of life. I didn’t even know how it ended.
In a way, I was glad Darren had knocked me out. It meant I didn’t have to continue watching the torture show that I would never forget. But now, I had a new horror to panic for. Darren had revealed he really was planning on killing my entire family. It had been a month since he last revealed the idea to me, and I thought maybe he had dropped it since then, but apparently I was wrong. The thought of him forcing me to watch them die as I had watched the gardener had me panicking all over. Time was of the essence now. I had to warn them. I had to get a message out, but I didn’t know how.
I certainly couldn’t use another person as my messenger. Darren would just kill them and ensure I had a front row seat to that show, too. I had to figure something out. I had to get this goddamn collar off me! I didn’t think I would be able to escape Darren entirely. Even if I somehow destroyed the collar, I had a strong feeling Darren would still find me. I couldn’t make this escape about me. I had to make it about them, about my family. I just needed to warn them to run. If I could do that, if I could

accomplish that one single goal, then that would be enough for me. I would take whatever punishment Darren would rain down on me for running because it would be worth it a thousand times over if it meant my family would be safe from him.
But what if that wasn’t enough? What if, even after I successfully escaped, Darren still found them? I couldn’t force my family into that kind of life, of running all the time, if it could be avoided, especially if it meant Darren would eventually find them anyway and then make me watch them die. I couldn’t do that. I wouldn’t survive it.
Maybe what I really had to do was just bite the literal bullet and accept my life as it was. Maybe if I made a deal with the devil and sacrificed myself for them, he would spare them and I could live on knowing they would, too. Maybe that would finally be enough for me.
After what felt like days later, Darren finally returned to me. I remained in the same position, curled up on my side, my arms wrapped around myself as I stared off into the distance. I refused to even acknowledge him.
I heard him release a heavy sigh as he reached down and unlocked my cage, opening the door and waiting for me to exit. I stayed right where I was. Even though my body was sore and cramped from the small space, I’d rather stay in there for the rest of the day then spend a single moment with Darren.
“Come on, Jaden. Let’s go,” he urged me, snapping his fingers. His voice was soft, but I could tell he was losing his patience. Still, I remained.
Another sigh escaped him as he rolled his eyes and bent down to the opposite end of the cage. He quickly lifted it up with one hand and I inevitably slid out of the cage and onto the carpeted floor. Darren was quick to seize me before I could retreat to the safety of my cage and hauled me to my feet. I tried to jerk away from him, but his hands held my upper arms, preventing me from moving.
“Stop it,” he ordered softly, annoyance tagging along in his voice.
I halted my protest, finding it pointless as I stared off blankly at his chest, my lips curling back in disgust. I felt his warm hand gently grip my chin and lift my face toward him, exposing my bruised cheek so he could get a better look. He stared at it for quite some time, and I noticed something in his eyes that I had not expected to see—regret. Did he actually feel bad for hitting me like that? I’d never seen him care after he’d

backhanded me, but I guess actually punching me with a closed fist was something entirely different to him.
I took this moment to examine his cheek as well, the one I had slammed my elbow in. He had a small purple and red mark on the bone, but it apparently didn’t bother him as much as mine did.
Darren lightly took my face in his hands and sprinkled tiny kisses against my bruised cheek. I felt my body tremble with anguish as he tried to comfort me for what he had done. A single tear slid down my cheek over my bruise and Darren kissed it away, his thumbs tracing along my jaw, making it that much harder not to crumble before him. It just made me sick to my stomach.
“I’m so sorry, Jaden,” he whispered. “I didn’t mean for this to happen.” “Like this is the worst thing you’ve ever done to me,” I replied bitterly.
He could punch me in the face as many times as he wanted. I could take it. As long as he left my family alone, I would take it. Gladly.
“And it probably won’t be the last,” he replied softly, his lips against my temple. “Especially with an attitude like that.”
“I want to make a deal with you,” I said seriously.
Darren pulled back and looked at me, an intense look of surprise across his face.
“You want to make a deal with me,” he replied, narrowing his eyes at me.
“Yes.”
“I’m not sure you have much to bargain with,” he said, regarding me closely.
“I have a lot more than you think,” I replied with confidence. “Well, let’s hear your proposal,” Darren said with intrigue.
“You have me, this much is obvious, but what you don’t have … is me
voluntarily.”
Darren raised any eyebrow at me, but I could tell he knew where I was going with this.
“Not yet.” He smirked.
“Precisely,” I replied. “If you agree to leave my family alone, to let them live out their days without harm, then I will remain yours voluntarily for as long as you want me.”
This time, both of his eyebrows raised.

“I’ll obey every word you say without question or complaint. I won’t argue, I won’t try to run, and I won’t fight you unless you want me to. I’ll surrender my subconscious to your rules and become the perfect little princess you’ve always wanted. I’ll walk down that aisle in a white dress or nothing at all and give you as many sons as you ask of me. You’ll be able to trust me to leave your sight and return to you without command or coercion. I will be yours for the rest of my life and admit it to you every day without revulsion and replace it with pride. All I ask of you in return is that you simply let my loved ones live.”
That was it. I had officially surrendered my soul to the devil to spare my family his torment. I felt my heart break as I realized what I was giving up, but in the end, knowing they would live would be worth it no matter the sacrifice.
Darren stared at me for a good long time. I pleaded with my eyes for him to take my offer. He had to have known his life would be so much easier if I was cooperative and accepting of what he wanted from me. This was the deal of a lifetime. Fucking literally.
As I looked up into that dark deep blue of his, something shifted in them, and a slight smirk formed in the corner of Darren’s lips.
“My sweet, sweet, Jaden,” he smiled. “That is one hell of a deal you’ve presented.”
I felt my insides quiver as I waited with baited fucking breath for his response.
Take the deal. Take the fucking deal!
“But why on Earth would I agree to give up something I desire for something I’m already going to achieve?”
I felt my eyes bulge as I stared up at him. Was he seriously turning me down?
“Wait, what?” I asked, not sure I even understood. Darren still held my face in his hands, and he suddenly began to walk forward, forcing me to take several steps backward as I fought to remain balanced.
“You see, Jaden, everything you just offered me is already going to happen anyway, regardless of whether I agree to spare your family or not. Voluntary or not makes no difference to me. You are mine no matter what you try to rationalize and no amount of bargaining will change that. In fact, those lovely words you just declared can be considered your wedding vows to me because that is exactly what I expect from you and, in time, that is

exactly what I will get from you. I don’t need to make a deal with you to ensure that. I hate to break it to you, princess, but I’m declining your offer because, like I said, you have nothing to bargain with.”
I felt my entire being completely shut down. I felt my knees give out, but Darren caught me and held me against him. I felt myself begin to hyperventilate as I came to the realization that the devil didn’t need to bargain for my soul … because he already fucking had it. My body shivered with fear as more hushed tears rolled down my face, soaking Darren’s shirt. “Shh …” Darren whispered, his arm tight around my body, as his hands caressed up and down my back. “You’re going to be all right, Jaden.
It will be hard at first, but eventually, it will get easier. I promise.”
Rage instantly built up inside of me again. It would get easier? He thought it would get easier for me once my family was dead?! Was this guy on drugs?! How could he possibly expect me to forgive him for this!
I tried to contain it, but it needed an outlet. Badly.
“You …” I started to say softly, and eventually, I finally found my voice. “You can’t fucking do this to me!” I shouted at him, pulling away, but his arms remained around me. “I’ve already given you everything! Why the fuck do you need to take them from me, too?!”
“Jaden, stop it,” he demanded sternly, his hands now gripping my upper arms tightly.
“No! Get the fuck off me! Let go of me! I fucking hate you! I can’t even stand the sight of you!”
I started to cry. I couldn’t help myself. I felt so weak and pathetic as I tried to break free from his hold, but he was just too goddamn strong. Irritated as shit, I finally brought my foot up to kick him. He absorbed the kick, grunting as he did and then threw me roughly on the floor. I crashed against the carpet and had no energy left to fight him. My anguish was absolutely exhausting. My face still hurt, and my body had nothing left to give. I just curled into myself, covering my face and ears with my hands in a futile attempt to hide from him.
I could feel him standing over me, could feel his rage seep from him, infecting the air around us, and it made me sick to my stomach.
“Keep behaving like this, Jaden, and I swear to God, you won’t see the light of day for a very long time,” he warned, his eyes gleaming down at me.

I felt my lips curl in absolute hatred. What difference did it make? It wasn’t as if I would ever feel real light in my life ever again. I looked up at him from the floor, my fists curling at my chest, and I wanted nothing more than to hurl myself at him and gouge his eyes out with my thumbs. But something else entirely roared off my tongue.
“If you kill them, you’ll be taking away my only reason to live. If there’s nothing left of them, you will find nothing left of me in return. Then we’ll see who’s really won this little battle, won’t we?”
My new attempt at threats was stone cold and serious. Why would I want to continue living if my only reason for living was gone? This was my personal Hell. If death was my only escape, then maybe that was the better way out. I wouldn’t be able to accomplish my goal of killing Darren and bringing his criminal organization to the ground, but at least, he would have to continue living without his obsession. He could spend the rest of his miserable days in want, knowing I was free of him and resting peacefully with my loved ones. Maybe that was the only way I could truly get back at him, truly win.
Darren’s hands casually shifted into his pockets as he remained unfazed by my latest threat. A little grin began to form at the corner of his lips while his eyes blazed with that intensity that made me quiver inside.
“Please,” he said, amused. “Like you’d ever allow yourself to become that weak as to end your own life. And besides,” he said, resting his arm on the tall bedpost and leaning over me, “I plan on giving you a whole new reason to live. And they have little feet tinier than yours.”
His arrogance was beyond annoying as well as disgusting. It was as if no matter what I said, what I proposed or threatened, Darren would not budge. It was his way without even the option of the highway. Fuck, if I had that option, I’d be speeding down it so fast, I’d have the entire county police department on my tail.
So that was it then. Plan A it is.
“Now, if you’ll excuse me,” he said, heading for the door, “I have some work to do.”
Panic rushed me as I realized the work he was referring to was probably locating my family for their execution. I threw myself forward from the floor and raced after him.
“Wait! Darren, don’t!” I shouted as I ran after him, but by the time I reached the door, he had just closed it without even bothering to turn around

as the lock clicked into place. My entire body slammed into the door while my fists pounded into the hard oak. “Darren, please don’t do this! Don’t leave me in here!” But I could already hear him walking up the stairs.
I pounded on the door for what felt like hours, kicking it and throwing my body with as much force as I could muster, but it never fell. My entire body ached along with my fists as bruises formed all over the place.
I shoved myself from the door and paced back and forth in the black room, my hands sweaty with anxiety as I thought long and hard about how to break the fuck out of this prison that was my life. How could I get a message to my family to run?
I felt myself begin to hyperventilate. I needed to calm myself the fuck down if I was going to think clearly and figure this out. I forced myself to stop pacing and stood very still, taking long, deep breaths and exhaling them slowly. I needed to be rational; I needed to focus.
In a room surrounded by sex toys of pain and torture, I found a way to drown it all out and concentrate on one singular moment. I lowered myself down to my knees, parted them slightly in a comfortable position, and placed my hands lightly on top of my thighs. Bowing my head, I closed my eyes and quieted my mind. I silenced everything around me until the only thing I could hear was the sound of my own heartbeat.
I listened to it intently; the sound and strength of each beat resonated through me while I brought myself to an absolute calm. Nothing was around me for miles, nothing above me or below me. There was just me and nothing else.
I relaxed every muscle in my body one by one, releasing the tension from my shoulders that reached all the way to my lower back. I took long, deep breaths, sucking them in through my nose and breathing out through my mouth, releasing all my stress and anguish.
I took about ten minutes of pure solid meditation before my heart rate had slowed and I felt in control of myself again. My fear was gone, replaced with determination for a solution.
And then it all went to shit when my stomach growled like a miserable little bitch.
I had forgotten I hadn’t eaten yet, and it was probably well into the afternoon. It wasn’t like Darren to starve me, but maybe with today’s events, he’d forgotten. I stood up from my position, my stomach now tight from hunger pains as I walked over to the edge of the bed and sat down,

facing the door. My hands gripped the edge of the mattress as I waited for Darren to enter the room. It was maybe an hour later when the door finally opened.
I nearly jolted forward, ready to rush the door when I saw Scott slide half of his body through to glare at me in warning.
“Don’t.” He pointed at me. “There are two more guards out here, so don’t bother trying anything. I’m just bringing you some food since you haven’t eaten all day.”
I just glared at him, my knuckles turning white as they continued to grip the mattress.
“Well, make it quick before I change my mind,” I warned him, a slight hint of bitchy sarcasm on my tongue.
He gave me a smirk and then walked in with a silver tray, quickly shutting the door behind him. I watched him with hard eyes as he set the tray down on the nightstand and headed back to the door.
“Tell me,” I said to him before he opened the door. He turned to look at me. “Are you looking forward to helping Darren hunt down my family or are you just following orders?”
He just shook his head at me with a glare and shut the door behind him, the sound of the lock vibrating in the pit of my stomach. I turned my head toward the tray sitting on the nightstand and walked over to it. There was a plastic bowl of what looked like a thick potato soup, a plate of Greek salad, and a cup of mixed fruit. There was also a giant bottle of water with a small folded note next to it. I picked it up and unfolded it to find Darren’s writing.

Your practice of meditation is impressive. Use it to contain your outbursts next time and I may not have to punish you as often.
-Darren

Fury raced through my veins as I crumpled the note in my hand and chucked it at the door. Fuck him for watching me. He was always watching, though, so I didn’t know why I was surprised. I snatched the bottle of water from the tray and gulped down nearly half of it. I nibbled on the soup and salad and had only a few bites of the fruit. With all the knots in my stomach, I didn’t have much room for anything else.

Exhausted and full, I laid my head down on the pillow and curled into myself. I closed my eyes and hoped for the first time that maybe I just wouldn’t wake up and this would all be over.







Chapter Thirty-Five. Crumble.
I heard screaming. Sharp screams that pierced my ears. I could see the
gardener screeching in fear, his face and body covered in blood as he watched while his family was murdered in front of his eyes. But someone else was standing in the background, someone I had forced myself to forget long ago. Megan, the girl from the warehouse, whom I had tried to instill hope in only for her to have her neck snapped by Darren right in front of my eyes. I now had two deaths to claim responsibility for and it made me weep.
“Your fault,” Megan said in the background as she watched the gardener with calm indifference.
“No,” I whispered back, my tears ready to drown me.
Then a loud bang shattered my ears and a small black and red bullet hole appeared between the eyes of the gardener.
My vision warped until I suddenly saw my family, my friends … Jason. They were all running, running from a storm of bullets that rained down on them from all directions. Blood spilled and splattered everywhere, coating everything in a dark glossy red. I fought to save them, but I felt paralyzed, unable to move even an inch to try to help them. I watched as both of my younger brothers fell to the ground, deep crimson soaking their clothes, the light slowly draining from their eyes.
I jolted from my sleep as a scream ripped from my throat, shredding my vocal cords. My breath came in and out in heavy gusts as I fought to calm myself down. Sweat covered my body while my fingers gripped the tangled sheets around me. I tried to get a grip on myself and released the sheets before my knuckles decided to burst through my skin. I ran my hands through my hair and took several long, deep breaths, but as I started to finally calm down, I realized I was back in my room and I was not alone.
I raised my eyes to find Darren sitting on the chaise next to the window watching me. Shadowed in darkness, I couldn’t see his face very

well, but I knew exactly where his eyes were.
“What are you doing here?” I asked him angrily. “Do I really need a reason?” he answered calmly. I suppose not.
I let the question linger before he stood from the chaise and walked over to the bed. I shot out from the covers and moved to the other side to avoid him as best I could. As I moved, my clothing felt different. I was no longer in the torn dress I wore earlier but in one of those silky nightgowns. No bra or panties.
“Now is not the time to fight me, Jaden. It’s after one in the morning.
Get back into bed,” he said as he slowly sauntered toward me.
“Get. Out,” I spat, my body turning to the side as it prepared for a
fight.
Darren shook his head at me disapprovingly, his light footsteps
beginning to close the distance between us. I could feel the panic mixed with rage creating a storm of hatred and passion inside of me. And fuck if it didn’t drench me.
“Get back in bed,” he ordered sternly, pointing at my messy bed.
“No,” I replied harshly.
Oh, shit. The forbidden word.
Darren then lunged for me with an animalistic scowl on his face. I quickly backed up from his advance, but just before my back was about to hit the wall behind me, I brought my foot all the way up and shoved it right under his chin at his throat, nearly stopping him in his tracks. My leg was in a full split as it stretched as high as it could go to reach Darren’s trachea.
He stood there, towering over me with my foot neatly tucked under his chin as it pushed against his Adam’s apple. My fists remained in front of me, tight and defensive as I stared him right in the eye, glaring with everything I had, but all he did was smirk at me with a certain knowing smile.
Then he quickly jostled with his pants, grabbed my hips, and suddenly entered my now fully exposed opening with so much force, had he not been directly in front of me, I would have doubled over.
“Oh, fuck!” I groaned loudly from shock as his cock was now firmly nestled in my core. How fucking stupid was I to leave myself so exposed for something like that?
No panties on? Jaden, you fucking idiot!

Anger flooded my face as I tried to retract my leg from his chin, but now, he just held it in place against his shoulder and shoved me further into the wall with his giant muscular body.
“Ah!” I gasped as I felt the full force of him inside me.
“Well, this is quite the position you’ve created. We might have to try this one more often.” Darren grinned with amusement as he grazed his fingers up and down my leg before clutching my ankle in a tight grip.
I tried to make use of my hands and began to strike Darren wherever I could find his flesh, but he just grabbed my hands and pinned them above my head with one hand. His other hand then went to the back of my hip and he began to savagely pump away inside me.
I felt my eyes roll to the back of my head as Darren brought my body to heel while he fucked me senseless against the wall. My core was instantly wet at the feel of him, my body’s conditioning for him never failing to surprise me.
Darren then bent low and picked me up by my ass before swiftly turning and slamming me down onto the bed. He practically ripped his own shirt	off,	revealing	a	sexy,	heavily	chiseled	and	scarred	chest	and repositioned himself so that my leg was now bent over his shoulder as he continued to fuck me relentlessly. His hands then went to the hem of my nightgown and ripped it clean in half like it was paper, exposing everything. With an animalistic growl, Darren took my wrists and pinned them on either side of my head while his head dipped low and he rubbed his face into my breasts. My back involuntarily arched as he took one of my nipples into his mouth, sucking hard until it peaked to his satisfaction. My breath came in and out in heavy little gasps as I felt myself on the cusp of one hell
of an orgasm.
How I could ever find pleasure with a man like him, I have no idea. Somehow, in the midst of it all, I had trained myself to accept him because it was so much easier to accept his pleasure than to suffer his pain. There was no denying him. Ever. Otherwise, my pleasure fuck would instantly turn into a punishment fuck, and I had experienced enough of those to avoid them when I could.
I tried so hard to keep my moans down, to hide my pleasure, but somehow, he’d always find that spot of mine. That spot that could send me into overdrive in 3.5 seconds. My special little come button.

“Oh, fuck,” Darren groaned as he drilled into me, and before I knew it, I was coming like my life depended on it.
I moaned louder than I expected as the warm rush swept over me and I felt a tiny moment of bliss. Darren rode my waves and then flipped me onto my stomach, pulling my hips into his groin as he fucked me roughly from behind.
He moaned above me as he pumped in and out before gripping a fist full of my hair and jerking my head back to expose my neck. I felt his head dip low until his teeth found my throat and bit down hard. I shrieked with a moan as my fingers dug further into the sheets, grasping for something to hang on to.
When his teeth released my skin, his lips found my ear. “What have I repeatedly told you about using that word?” he growled.
Fear crept up my spine, allowing another gush of heat to rush to my core. My fear of him somehow quickly became the cause of my arousal as the two now came hand in hand. There was something so different about being afraid while you were being fucked – like fucking in public; it made everything that much more surreal. The rush I got from it was sometimes exactly what I needed. It was like fucking on a plane … right before you knew it was about to crash.
Darren’s hand reached around my throat, his thumb lining up against my jaw as he gripped it tight, inevitably pulling me back toward him. “You’re mine,” he seethed and slapped my ass hard. I groaned loudly as he continued to pump into me, slow and hard, hitting that spot every time until I was on the verge of coming undone a second time. His hand finally made its way to my breast and pinched my nipple, causing me to gasp and jerk against him until he flipped me again onto my back without missing a beat.
Wrapping my legs around his torso, his thrusts quickly found my spot again, driving me wild and nearly begging for more. His hand shot back to my throat and held on tight as he continued to fuck me with everything he had. I had to give it to him. His stamina was incredible.
My hands wrapped around his wrist as he began to grip too tight; so tight I could feel my vision begin to blur and darken. But then I heard his voice.
“Oh fuck, Jaden. Come, now,” he rasped, loosening his grip on my throat but keeping it in place possessively.

The orgasm that came next was absolute euphoria. It washed over me slowly, but with a fierce intensity that rivaled my other orgasms. Darren found his release as he filled me up and then collapsed on top of me, his face buried in my hair that fanned out around my head.
We both laid there, exhausted and panting as we calmed down from our orgasmic state. When Darren finally lifted his face from my hair, he looked deep into my eyes, a longing within them I didn’t recognize.
“Goddamn, princess, I am never letting you go,” he said with conviction.
This much I knew, but one thing was still nagging at me that I had always wanted to know.
“Why? Why do you call me that?” I asked softly, shaking my head in wonder.
He knew how much I hated that pet name. I was no fucking princess. I never was and never wanted to be. Princesses required rescuing. And the real princess was my freedom. I was the knight in shining armor still battling the dragon that held it captive. A dragon named Darren Davis.
Darren slowly lowered his forehead to mine, resting it there for a moment before gazing down at me with amusement and adoration.
“Because your king has yet to make you his queen,” he whispered simply with the slightest smile.
I didn’t expect that response, yet somehow, that bit of Darren logic made perfect sense to me. And I had no idea how to reply to that.
He then gave me that sexy chuckle of his and kissed me something fierce. When he was done, and I was breathless, he pulled me toward the pillows and laid my head down on his chest. He wrapped my arm around his muscled torso and draped my leg over his thigh.
As my body melted into him, guilt flooded me like a tidal wave. I had just received pleasure from a man who was currently planning to kill my entire family. I felt weak and pathetic as a single tear slid down my cheek and fell onto Darren’s chest. His arms slowly tightened around me as he could feel my anguish start to consume me. My tears fell consecutively, heavy with sorrow, guilt, and hopelessness. After everything he had done, he couldn’t possibly be this cruel to me. He couldn’t.
“Please … please don’t kill them, Darren,” I pleaded softly, squeezing my eyes shut. “Please. I’ll do anything.”

I could hear Darren release a slow, heavy breath through his nose before he brought his lips to my head and kissed my temple.
“Shhh … of course, you will,” he replied softly. “Now, go to sleep.”
Of course, I will … because I’m already supposed to.
That night I cried myself to sleep in Darren’s arms while he comforted me with kisses and a gentle touch. I wanted to berate him, I wanted to push him away, and I wanted to fight him until the end of my days—until there was nothing left of me—but even the thought of all that was exhausting. So instead I closed my eyes and pretended to drift off to better times when I was happy and loved. Not owned and imprisoned.







Chapter Thirty-Six. Plan.
The next morning, I woke up alone and sore as fuck. My entire body hurt
while a sting of tenderness throbbed between my legs. I turned my body, resting my head on the pillow, and stared out the window. The sun was low in the sky, just rising above the water and creating a soft, warm glow in my room. I listened to the birds chirp and sing outside, their songs serenading me into a calm I wanted to drown myself in.
I laid there like that for the longest time, just listening and enjoying a small moment of peace that I rarely got to experience since coming into Darren’s life. I never thought it was possible to hate someone so much yet need them at the same time. Darren comforted me through my tears last night, never saying a word as he rubbed my back and kissed my temple. I didn’t know how he could comfort me knowing he was the cause of my pain, knowing he would continue to cause my pain when he could avoid it altogether. How he could even stand to look at himself in the mirror was a mystery to me.
He had to be a sociopath. It was the only explanation. How could he not feel a single ounce of remorse for me? There was no sympathy. No compassion. Just his never-ending will. What Darren wants, Darren gets, no matter the cost. I wanted to cost him everything—his money, his reputation, his heart, his mental status, and then his life. I wanted him to regret the day he ever laid eyes on me … and one day soon, I swore I would see that.
Some hours later, it was past 8 a.m., and I decided it was time to get ready for the day. I rolled out of bed and stretched my body like a cat, rolling my shoulders and neck until the tension in my muscles eased away. I stood and padded over to the bathroom, used the toilet, and showered. I did everything I could to avoid my face in the mirror, but I knew I would have to look at myself eventually in order to cover the giant bruise I knew was there on the side of my cheekbone.

When I stepped out of the shower, I towel dried my hair and went to my vanity to begin the cover-up process, but when I raised my eyes to my reflection, I almost broke down in tears. Dark purple, green, and red smudged the side of my face in a massive bruise the size of a baseball, and I could see the exact spot where Darren’s knuckles had made contact. They had broken the skin. I almost wanted to leave it uncovered just to spite him, to show him the damage he had done, hoping he might display a human side and express a little fucking guilt for once.
But unfortunately, I couldn’t stand the sight of myself. I layered on the concealer, covering it up as best I could, but the dark shadow of purple still lingered under it all. I parted my wet hair so that my bangs would hang over the same side of my face that harbored the bruise in another attempt to hide it. I dried my hair and styled it into soft, loose curls, fanning them out around my shoulders and down my back. My hair was getting longer. It now reached well past my shoulder blades. I didn’t typically grow it this long, preferring it to be only a few inches below my collarbone. It was easier to manage that way and was less annoying.
I chose a silky soft silvery blue sundress to wear and the nude flats I had finally broken in months before. I looked down at the diamond studded infinity ring from Tiffany’s that Darren had gifted me so long ago. I wanted to chuck it into his mouth so he’d choke on it, but that wasn’t gruesome enough of a death for me.
At 8:55 a.m., I slowly made my way down the stairs and found Darren sitting at the table with some paperwork in his hands. He was reading with a focused face when I finally sat down. When I scooted my chair in, he looked up from his work and smiled at me.
“Good morning,” he said.
“Morning,” I mumbled back and began to make myself some tea.
I could feel his eyes on me, scrutinizing me, but thankfully, my hair fell down the side of my face and blocked his vision from my eyes.
“Did you do something different with your hair?” he asked me. I shrugged without looking at him. “I switched the part.”
His eyes narrowed then for a moment before he finally leaned forward, reaching out with his hand and tucked my hair behind my ear to expose my bruised cheek. I didn’t look at him. Not even when he gently gripped my chin and tilted my face up so he could get a better look at what he’d done. I managed to catch a glimpse of his bruise on his cheek, and it

was actually healing rather quickly. Darren was silent for a moment as he analyzed the damage, his thumb softly grazing the skin, causing me to reveal the tiniest wince. He released a heavy sigh as he stared at me, and for some reason, it sounded like regret.
“I’m sorry,” he said gently. “But I warned you what could happen if you didn’t listen to me.”
I scoffed at him. Like I actually gave a shit about his apology.
“I don’t want your sorry. I want you to let me go.”
Darren released an irritated sigh as he sat back in his chair, glaring at

me.

“And that little request is exactly why I’m doing what I’m doing.”
“I’m sorry,” I said, not sure I even understood him, “but you’re going

to kill my entire family because I want you to let me go? The fuck kind of logic is that?” I seethed.
“Watch your mouth,” he warned with a serious glare in his eye. “And I already told you. I’m eliminating the element that is causing you to regress from your life with me. I need you focused on the future, not the past.”
“And you think killing my family will ensure that I give in to you?
Again, the fuck kind of logic is that!”
“Cuss one more time and your ass with match your cheek,” Darren growled, his threat causing me to curl my fists in my lap until they shook. “I expect that once you’re over your mourning period, you’ll realize there is nothing left for you to hold on to, no reason for you to try to escape me, and you will finally give up this senseless fight and give in to me.”
I shook my head at him, closing my eyes and fighting back tears while my fingers nearly broke from the tension in my fists.
“You have no idea how wrong you are,” I said, staring straight into his eyes with conviction. “I would never forgive you for this. I will always have a reason to get away from you, no matter what you do.”
“We’ll see about that.” He smirked.
“You can’t honestly expect me to just sit around and let you do this.”
“I don’t imagine there is much you can do about it,” he said taking a sip of his coffee before setting it back down on the table.
“Don’t underestimate me, Darren. That will be your biggest mistake,” I replied confidently.
His hand was on my throat before I could even blink.

“And challenging me will be yours,” he snarled with absolute malice. His eyes blazed with an intense anger as his grip on my throat quickly became a vise. I didn’t even bother to try to stop him. I just scowled at him,
holding back my tongue as I fought for oxygen, hoping he’d let go.
After what felt like hours, he finally released me and stood, putting his suit jacket on over his white dress shirt and black tie. My throat burned as I coughed and gasped for air, tears beginning to build in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall.
“I have to go away on a business trip tomorrow. I’ll be gone a few days.”
Bye, Felicia.
And then Darren’s mouth dropped real low to my ear.
“Maybe if you behave while I’m gone, I won’t make you watch,” he said, but I could taste the venom in his words as he spoke about murdering my family. He was so good at motivational speeches.
“How nice of you,” I answered, my eyes looking straight ahead.
Darren then roughly gripped my jaw and kissed me hard on the mouth. His tongue forced its way through my lips and tangled with my own. I felt the heat rush through me and melt into my core as his thumb dug into the side of my jaw while his lips made a victim out of mine. He then released my face and looked down at me.
“You’re to remain inside today,” he said and I immediately scowled at him, only for Darren to return the gesture. “Be thankful I don’t lock you in your room instead. I’ll see you at dinner.” He sneered and then walked out the door, Scott and another guard hot on his heels.
Not more than ten seconds after he left, David came out with my breakfast and placed it down in front of me before walking away without so much as a glance. My plate contained scrambled eggs, a bowl of sliced mixed fruit, and some toast. I had zero intentions to eat any of it, wanting to spite Darren as much as I could, but I had barely eaten anything yesterday and I needed to keep my strength up. I swigged back my vitamins, the burn in my newly sensitive throat making it hard to swallow, and pulled my plate forward. I angrily ate my eggs and scarfed down my fruit, nearly shoving my plate across the table when I was done.
Since I was now once again confined to the walls of the house, I got up and started to wander around, looking at random things, trying to piece together a way to get the fuck out of here. What could I use to successfully

escape this place? I needed to break out of this goddamn collar like now. I was running out of time, and I needed to figure something out fast.
I wandered for hours, sat around to think, wandered some more, and then reluctantly ate lunch in the dining room. Pascal could tell I was stressed, so he made me a bowl of homemade chicken noodle soup. Hands down the best soup I’d ever had, especially since it was easy for me to digest.
I then proceeded to aimlessly wander the house some more. I passed several guards here and there and the cleaning staff, but no one paid any attention to me. Some of the staff even seemed to hurry away from me when they saw me coming. Didn’t that make me feel special? They’d probably gotten wind of what happened to the gardener and feared any sort of interaction with me would create the same fate for them. I didn’t blame them. They were probably right.
I meandered into the theater and considered watching a movie, but it would only distract me rather than inspire a genius escape plan. I left the theater in a disappointed huff, cutting around a corner too fast and nearly tripped over my own feet. My toes on my right foot began to sting as I looked down to examine it. It was then that I realized I had fully ruined my shoe, the thin black rubber sole now peeling off the tip of my shoe. And then suddenly I froze.
Rubber.
Rubber could block an electric charge. It might not be able to block a GPS signal, but it might be all I needed to get the fuck out just long enough to contact my family. My heart suddenly started to pace. Why hadn’t I thought of this before? I was too focused on getting the damn collar off rather than thinking of a temporary way around it.
Rubber may only be my temporary path to salvation, but maybe that was all I really needed. If I could execute a plan properly, I might be able to escape the estate, but it wouldn’t stop Darren or his men from finding me. Unless by some miracle I found something to cut the collar off before the GPS gave me away. I seriously doubted it.
I nonchalantly made my way back to my room and kicked my shoes off by the bed, nearly swiping them underneath it. The only place I could think of that the cameras couldn’t see. I then sat down at my vanity and looked at myself in the mirror. My eyes landed on the giant bruise on the side of my face, and as I stared intently into the mirror, focusing on

everything I currently hated about my life … I finally lost it. I screamed and abruptly stood up, whipping all the makeup, brushes, and tools from the vanity, and knocking them all over the floor, deliberately managing to get several things under the bed.
I gripped my hair and paced the room back and forth, my chest heaving up and down, and adding further evidence to my pretend temper tantrum. I knew eventually Darren would be watching this, and I didn’t want to give him any kind of suspicion of what I was doing before I was even able to accomplish it. To be honest, though, it wasn’t hard to fake.
After several minutes of pacing the room and nearly ripping my own hair out, I finally collapsed on the chaise and sat with my head in my hands over my knees. I shed a few tears, which was understandably easy, and eventually tried to get a grip. When I felt I’d displayed a fine temper tantrum, I began to wipe my eyes with my hands and started to slowly pick up all the makeup I had shoved to the floor. I crawled on my hands and knees until every last blush, brush, and palette was picked up and put back neatly on my vanity. Then I bent low to look under my bed to find several missing lip gloss tubes and eye shadows, along with my broken nude flats.
I slipped under the bed until half my body was covered and immediately began pulling at the remaining glue and strings that held the sole to the shoe. It actually ripped away fairly easy. I quickly removed the other sole with the pair of tweezers and a metal nail file I had conveniently swiped under the bed. I now had two thin rubber soles in my hands, the possible key to my escape. I placed them between my collar and neck and they fit perfectly snug around my throat.
Now, I just needed to find a way to mold them together. I needed some super glue or even a sewing kit would do. I slipped out from under my bed and started rummaging through all my drawers and cabinets, but found nothing in my room, closet, or bathroom. I tried to make it look like I wasn’t looking for something, but it probably wouldn’t convince Darren. Eventually, I wandered back out into the halls until I found one of the offices and started randomly opening drawers, pretending I was just bored and completely disinterested, yet still found nothing of use. But when I got to the second office, my motives were finally noticed.
“Ms. Jaden,” I heard a serious voice say behind me and immediately turned to the guard now standing in the doorway.

“Yes?” I said, addressing him. It was the same guy who had pulled me out of the house the other day. The same guy who helped torture the gardener.
“Looking for something?” he asked me expectedly.
Crap, they were on to me.
“Oh, I was just looking for a sewing kit or maybe some fabric glue,” I said innocently, shrugging my shoulders. “There’s a tear in my dress that I’d like to fix.”
I was sure I could find a tear in this flimsy material somewhere. The guard aimed his eyes at me with a cautious glare.
“Mr. Davis will buy you a new dress. There is no need to repair it.”
I gave a huff of a laugh, trying to play it off. “Oh, there’s no need for a new dress. It’s just a little tear. I can easily fix it myself.”
“Miss,” the guard pressed with more warning in his voice. “Mr. Davis will buy you a new dress. Per his orders, please find something else to do with your time. Otherwise, you will have to spend the remainder of the day in your room until he returns.” With that, the guard left and disappeared from my sight.
Goddamn, Darren. Now, I had tipped him off. Fuck.
I gave up my pursuit and trudged my way back to my room. What the fuck was I going to do now? I had to find something to hold those soles in place. Otherwise, they would fall out and I’d be fucked and probably dead. Fuck, what else could I do? What resources did I have access to? My hands balled into fists as I paced my room, my fake-ass nails digging into my skin until the pain rearranged my focus. I opened my hands and looked down at my nails and a small lightbulb in my head turned on.
I might not have access to any tape or glue, but maybe some nail glue
…
I immediately went and changed into some workout clothes and
headed down to the gym. I then proceeded to beat the ever-living piss out of the punching bags, no gloves required. I sent the bag flying all over the place as I kicked and punched with unwrapped hands. Darren still had yet to provide me with a proper pair of gloves so this was what he got. I threw several palm-heel strikes at the bag until my knuckles tore and bled, and even then, I didn’t stop, too pissed off and too determined to break the one thing that might actually save my family. I threw in a few elbows here and there not to make it seem so obvious I was actually trying to break a nail.

And then I finally felt the snap. It hurt like a bitch when one broke, but it had to be done. I looked down at my left hand and smiled at the busted nail. Blood and bruises covered my knuckles, but it was a spectacular kind of pain. A worthy pain that resulted in success. I then completed my workout with a five-mile run on the treadmill and headed back upstairs for a long, hot shower.
I redid my hair and makeup, caking on the concealer again to hide my bruise, and made sure my hair parted the same way. I left my busted nail sharp and cracked to make sure Darren noticed; though I had a feeling the sight of my knuckles would draw his attention first. I’d cleaned all the blood off, disinfected it with rubbing alcohol, and applied an antiseptic. He’d probably be furious since obviously he was the only one allowed to put bruises on me but fuck him. Maybe next time, he should provide me with the proper hand protection I asked for and then we wouldn’t have this problem.
At 5:27 p.m., I made my way downstairs, sat at the dinner table, and waited for Darren to come home. I was all types of pissed off and anxious as I sat there waiting for him like the good little dog I was. And then finally at 5:32 p.m. the master of my universe walked through the door talking on his cell phone. His voice was short and clipped with the person on the other end, making it hard to tell if he was actually angry or if that was just his serious business voice. I’d heard it often and knew that just because he was serious didn’t necessarily mean he was mad. It just meant he was dangerously close.
He ended his conversation and sat down, releasing an exasperated sigh and quickly changed his demeanor. He looked at me with absolute adoration. It was annoying as fuck.
“And how’s my princess?” he said to me with a smirk.
I wanted to tell him to eat shit and die, but we were already going to fight. Might as well ease into it.
“Tired,” I said lightly as I shrugged, keeping my hands deliberately in my lap for the time being.
“Did you try taking a nap?” he asked me as he stood up and poured himself a short glass of bourbon from the open bar on the wall beside the table.
“No,” I said. “It’s hard to sleep when all I get are nightmares.” Darren gave me a knowing look.

“They will pass, Jaden. Eventually, you will become desensitized to such things and they won’t bother you anymore.”
“What do you mean I’ll become desensitized? Do you plan to have me sit through more of those torture sessions?”
Darren took a sip of his bourbon as he casually leaned back against the bar, one hand gripping the edge of the solid marble top.
“Yes,” he said simply, lowering his glass to look at me. “Why?” I asked, saddened and shocked all at the same time. “I’ve recently realized it will benefit the both of us,” he replied. “How do you figure that?”
“Because in my world, such sensitivity is considered a weakness, and I can’t have that. My world is very dark and bloody, and though I plan to hide it from you as best I can, there will be times when I simply can’t do that. You will inevitably be exposed to the gruesome and deadly moments of my life, and I’d rather have you prepared than to have to deal with you having a panic attack because you were unprepared in an unexpected situation. It could get you killed, and I will not allow that.”
I scoffed at him. “First of all, we both know I’m no little bitch.” I saw his face twitch with my cussing, but I continued quickly to distract him. “When I was taken, I reacted instinctively and refused to go down without a fight. I didn’t curl up and cower. I’m trained with guns and am plenty used to gunfire. Not to mention I took out two of your guards at the same time during the auction with ease. So don’t try to tell me I can’t handle a little blood and gore.”
“Then why did you react the way you did when you saw what was happening to that stupid fuck of a gardener,” Darren practically growled.
“Because I was the cause of it,” I replied. “He was only trying to help me and look where that got him. I could probably watch any one of your guys get tortured all day. Hell, I’d probably help. But when it comes to someone who’s innocent, that’s a different story.”
“You better be careful what you wish for, Jaden,” Darren said as he sauntered back over to his seat, his eyes never leaving mine. “I might just take you up on that.”
I gave him a barely-there smirk as he sat down.
David then brought out our dinner and set the plates down in front of us, returning silently to the kitchen. I reached out for my table napkin next

to my plate and saw Darren’s eyes light up. He promptly grabbed my wrist and examined my knuckles and busted manicure.
“What the fuck did you do to your hand?” he scowled at me.
I shrugged. “Well, Darren, you see, that’s what happens when you punch a heavy bag over and over again without proper hand protection. The same hand protection I asked you for several weeks ago.”
“So you thought you’d damage your beautiful skin just to spite me?” he nearly roared. My gut was flipping around like a damn roller coaster, but I remained steadfast.
“No, that was not my intention. I was angry, and I needed an outlet. It’s not healthy for me to keep all that rage bottled up, so I took it out on the bag. It’s not my fault I didn’t have the proper gear.”
Darren glared at me fiercely, on the rise of some horrible threat, but I beat him to it.
“Oh, what’s the matter, Darren? Jealous that something else left bruises on my skin and not you?” I taunted him. Yeah, I knew that was stupid, but I was in a mood.
He abruptly stood and slammed my bruised cheek down on the table. I groaned out loud as the pain radiated throughout my face. I kept my hands on the table and tried to push myself up to release some of a pressure, but Darren wasn’t letting up.
“Careful, princess. I just may leave you with a couple more.” “Yeah? Go ahead. Keep reminding me of why I hate you so much.” Darren leaned in low, getting closer to my ear as he stood above me.
“You still think I give a shit about how you feel about me? Your feelings do not matter unless I decide they do. And if this is the way you’re going to train to inevitably harm yourself, then your time in my gym will be revoked until you learn to control your so-called “rage.” Now, keep your mouth shut, and we might actually have a pleasant dinner together for once. Otherwise, you can spend the rest of the night in your cage.”
I grunted underneath him as I fought my hardest not to spit any shit back at him.
“Have I made myself clear?” he gritted.
“Yes, Darren,” I seethed through clenched teeth.
“Good girl,” he approved and released me, returning to his seat and unbuttoning his suit jacket.

He sent a quick text on his phone and began to eat his dinner while I sat there pissed off and stared at my water glass. I pushed my food around on my plate, my appetite now completely absent.
“Eat, Jaden,” Darren ordered with a glare.
I released an irritated sigh and took a small bite of my lemon chicken, tasting absolutely nothing as I chewed. Darren went back to eating his dinner, satisfied I had listened to him.
Dinner	was	quiet,	awkward	even,	but	thankfully	uneventful.	I somehow managed to finish most of my dinner and Darren only grumbled a little bit about it. When we were finished, he wiped his mouth and stood up. “I have some work to do. I’ll find you later,” he said as he kissed the
top of my head and disappeared upstairs.
I sat there for a while, leaning back against the chair with my hands splayed out on the table. I didn’t even care to move when David came out to clear our plates and didn’t even bother to look at him.
Eventually, I got up and went outside and onto the patio. I sat on the long, cushioned couch and laid down to look up at the sky, ignoring the guard who remained off to the side. The sky was starting to darken as the sun was already setting beyond the clouds. There was a slight chill in the wind, so I reached over to turn on the gas fire pit, watching as the flames licked at the fake wood that quickly surrounded the patio in warmth.
I felt my heart begin to race as I thought about the impending and very real opportunity of escape tomorrow. I knew Darren would schedule the Russians to come back as soon as possible. They would definitely be here tomorrow, which means I might actually get the fuck out of here. I didn’t expect to escape Darren completely, that would be too much to ask for. All I wanted was enough time to contact and warn my family. That was my only goal. If I could accomplish that, then Darren’s wrath, when he found me, would be worth it. I just prayed to God that Jason would answer the phone when I called.
I tried to decide what would be better: to flee with one of Darren’s sports cars or bikes. A car would be less dangerous but more difficult to hide and it would be easier for them to run me down. If I were on a bike, it would be more dangerous for them to apprehend me because I could fall off and die and then Darren wouldn’t have anyone to obsess over anymore. I could maneuver in ways a car couldn’t, and I could easily hide it behind a dumpster or something while I ran to find a phone. I could just imagine

revving up the engine now, the soft roaring purr echoing through my ears and bringing a smile to my face. Thankfully, the keys all hung on the wall next to the door. Easy access.
I would probably do it at night when the guards thought I was asleep and unsuspecting. I could turn the headlights off the bike and disappear into the night. Hopefully, it would be cloudy tomorrow. Darren would also already be in his new location by then, wherever the fuck that would be, so he’d be useless from where he was. He’d probably even take Scott with him and just leave me with the guards.
But there was no way I could slip away undetected. I would have to create some kind of distraction. The heat of the fire caught my attention and then I smiled. What better way than by burning Darren’s house down? He did have a sprinkler system installed inside, but I didn’t need to burn the whole thing down. Just enough to cause a distraction. There was a giant plastic bottle of rubbing alcohol in my bathroom. There were matches in my dresser for the candles in my room. And there was a glass bottle-like vase for the fresh flowers on my vanity.
Yep, I had everything I needed to make a Molotov cocktail …
The wheels in my head turned with devious determination as I mapped out my entire escape plan. All I needed now was the glue to hold it all together … more specifically, the nail glue my Russian friends would have when they repaired my broken nail.
Tomorrow could very well be one of the most important days of my life, as it could mean the life or death of everyone I held dear. Tomorrow … I might actually save them.
After an hour of laying out and pondering my escape route and potential setbacks, the sun had finally set and the stars now speckled the sky in a diamond-like radiance and I randomly wondered if Jason was looking up at the same sky as I was right now. I kind of hoped not. I hoped he was getting some actual sleep in our bed right now since he was several hours ahead of me back home.
A few minutes later, Darren walked out on the patio and my shiver instantly returned.
“There you are.” He smiled deviously.
“Here I am,” I replied blankly, not taking my eyes from the stars.
“You’ve been out here quite a while,” he said, sauntering over to me with his hands in his pockets.

I shrugged. “It’s nice out.”
With my body lying completely across the patio couch, there was no place left for Darren to sit, but of course, he didn’t let that stop him as he lifted me up by my shoulders and sat down under them, resting my head in his lap. He nonchalantly tucked my hair behind my ears and began to lightly play with my loose strands. Fuck, if that didn’t make me want to grow a tail and start purring.
I closed my eyes and enjoyed the sensation of his fingers through my hair, attempting to relax under his touch. He seemed to be in a better mood, and I did not intend to disrupt that, not when I was so close to getting out. I needed all of my privileges while I still had them. I was sure they would completely disappear again once Darren had recovered me. Things would be bad. I could feel it like a fog rolling in and surrounding me. But I didn’t care about the consequences because the consequences of doing nothing would be far greater than any punishment Darren would subject me to.
“What are you thinking about?” he suddenly asked me softly.
As if I was going to honestly tell him I was conspiring my escape plan. But I had a much better lie on the tip of my tongue.
“I’m thinking about what makes you tick,” I replied matter-of-factly.
“I told you that would be a waste of your time,” he said, looking down at me.
“I’ll decide when my time is wasted or not, thank you very much,” I countered with a bit of humor in my voice.
Darren actually chuckled above me. Thank fuck. We were silent for a moment until I finally got the courage to speak again.
“You were groomed for this life,” I stated as I looked out at the horizon.
“Yes, I was,” he answered.
“Are you happy with it? The way your life turned out?”
Darren scrutinized me with his eyes, and I changed the angle of my head to meet his gaze.
“I suppose,” he replied, yet there was uncertainty in his voice. “But for a while, something was missing and I didn’t know what it was.”
He started to curl a strand of my hair around his finger, but it wasn’t meant to be sentimental. It was a possessive gesture. Everything he did was. Like Gollum when he held his “precious” in his hands.
“And you’re hoping I’ll fill the void?” I asked without looking at him.

“I think it’s pretty clear you already have.”
“And what about the void in my life?”
“I will do everything I can to fill it,” he answered with conviction.
I slowly sat up from his lap and looked him right in the eye. He was never going to fill it. He would only make it bigger.
“And what do you plan to fill it with? More rules? Chains … blood, death?”
“Jaden …” he warned.
“I’m not trying to fight,” I spoke quickly, my open palms up in the air in surrender. “But I do have a hard time following your logic. If I understood where it came from, I wouldn’t have to question it as often as I do.”
“Jaden,” he started, pressing his hand on his knee and leaning in on it, his eyes completely focused on mine. “I grew up in a world that breeds monsters. I was taught how to fight, fuck, and rule without fear or regrets, and I’ve never looked back. I know what I do is wrong, but I simply do not care. The world is mine for the taking, and I already own so much of it as it is.” And then his face got real serious. “I do not have time for weakness, Jaden. I will do whatever it takes to secure my interests and investments and should a problem ever dare present itself, I will eliminate it without prejudice.”
I just stared at him intently, trying to piece him together. His hand gently caressed my bruised face, his thumb tracing along my cheek as his eyes softened their gaze at me.
“To put it bluntly, I am simply a man who takes what he wants, when he wants, because he can, princess. I can’t make it any plainer than that.”
And then his eyes could no longer hold my gaze. I looked away from him, suddenly sad and somewhat disappointed. But Darren didn’t let my mind wander far as he slowly leaned in for a deep and sensual kiss – the kind of kiss that made me forget my own name.
Both of his large hands now held my face in place as his tongue dipped into my mouth, claiming everything it could touch. Before I realized it, he had me pinned underneath him with my hands against the side of his muscled rib cage. He kissed me with a gentle urgency, telling me that he would miss me tomorrow when he left.
After dismissing the guard, he fucked me under the stars in a way that I could almost describe as making love. He was soft and gentle, caressing

me and kissing my entire body with love and adoration. It felt strange to me, but I didn’t object, preferring a light rainstorm to a thunderstorm for once.
I didn’t argue with him for the rest of the night, and when we were both thoroughly satisfied, he carried me up to his room where we fell asleep without a word. He held me close to his chest for the entire night as if he was afraid to let go; as if he was afraid I might slip away. He had no idea how right he was.







Chapter Thirty-Seven. Prepare.
The following morning, Darren and I had breakfast together after another
long fucking session. He informed me that the Russians would arrive around 1 p.m. to fix my nail and fill in the rest as well as trim my hair. I tried hard not to smile at the sweet smell of victory knowing my manipulation could still work.
I asked if I could pick the color again, but this time, he said no. Apparently, he didn’t care too much for the dark blood red color I chose last time. Darren also confirmed that nothing in my schedule would change while he was gone. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner would still be at the same times, and I was to listen to the guards unless I wanted to spend the remainder of his absence in my room. I was to be in bed by eleven, and he forbade me to use his gym until my hands healed. Too bad I had the slowest healing skin ever. It was my stupid porcelain pigmentation.
But it didn’t really matter. After today, he probably wouldn’t allow me to do anything ever again.
When breakfast was finished, Darren stood, buttoning his suit jacket and reaching out for my hand. I reluctantly took it, and he swiftly pulled me from my chair to him. He looked down at me with a serious look in his eyes, and it almost made me retreat into myself, but I refused to show it. Darren then took my face in his hands and kissed me. I could sense the anxiety in his kiss as this would be the first time he would be gone for this amount of time. A lot could happen in three days, and I was going to make sure of it.
When he released me, an intense glare emanated from his eyes.
“Please, behave yourself, Jaden,” he practically pleaded. “Because if you try anything while I’m gone, I swear to God …” He let it waver for a second and continued on, shaking his head. “If you think I’m bad now, you have no idea how much worse it will get should you try anything foolish. Do not disappoint me,” he finished.

None of this was a surprise and my mind was already prepared for it.
What it wasn’t prepared for was the loss of my family.
“I understand,” I finally answered.
“Good girl,” he approved, placing his lips against my temple.
He finally kissed the top of my head and pulled back. “I’ll see you in three days,” he said and then walked out the door.
And as soon as I heard the door shut behind him, I released a gigantic breath of relief. Come nightfall, I would be the fuck out of here. I felt all my anxiety begin to build inside of me, and I needed to get a hold of my nerves before they destroyed me. I had a couple of hours before the Russians would be here, and since Darren had uplifted my ban on going outside, I went for a run on the beach to clear my head.
I ran until I could hear my heartbeat drumming away in my ears. My blood was rushing, and I felt myself begin to panic. What if I failed? What if I got caught before I managed to get my message out? I didn’t even want to think about how bad it could get then.
To cool myself off, I literally just plopped myself in the water and floated over the sand. I pulled my ponytail out and let my hair flow through the water, my wet strands now floating around my face. The water felt perfect as it cooled down my core temperature and relaxed my anxiety.
My body drifted along the shore with the water. As it pushed me toward the sand and pulled me back into the waves, I closed my eyes to listen to the sound of the ocean and the birds above me. I was calm, peaceful, and ready for what had to be done. But after a few minutes of pure serenity, I was interrupted.
“Miss Jaden!” I heard one the guards call out to me. “You are not wearing proper swim attire! Please exit the water!”
Say what? I actually had to be in a bathing suit to go swimming?
Since the fuck when?
I looked up at the guard who was standing just beyond the sand and almost told him to fuck off. But I didn’t need the aggravation. Not right now. I rolled my eyes and stood up from the water, wringing my hair out and then shaking it like a dog would. I walked over toward the grass to find the guard, whom I had recognized as the same guard who addressed me yesterday, holding a towel out to me. I think his name was Eric? I took the towel from him and immediately began drying off.

“Since when do I need to be in a bathing suit to go swimming?” I asked him as I dried my hair with the towel.
“Since Mr. Davis said so. Now, come on,” he replied, ushering me toward the grass.
I swear to God, Darren cared about the dumbest shit sometimes. “What time is it?” I asked him as he escorted me back to the patio. “11:56. Pascal is preparing your lunch for you now,” he said sharply. I nodded. “I’ll just have it on the patio,” I said.
“I’ll inform the staff,” he replied.
My lunch consisted of a small Cobb salad with a lot of avocado and barely any ranch dressing. I also had a cup of mixed fruit and a yogurt with granola. I fucking hated how my food selections were always healthy. I typically ate healthy even before Darren, but there were plenty of times when I would let loose and put myself in a diabetic food coma. What I wouldn’t give for a giant bacon cheeseburger and a fucking beer.
After lunch, I had about a half an hour before my appointment, so I went upstairs to wash the salt water from my hair and body. I grabbed a black t-shirt and black skort from my drawers and walked over to my bed to pretend to get a good look at the time on my clock. I then bent down, placed my clothes on the floor next to the bed and pretended to scratch and observe my ankle. I then quickly slipped my hand under my bed and grabbed the two soles of my shoes, sneaking them between my clothes and heading into the bathroom. I placed my clothes on the counter and proceeded to take a shower. When I was done, I made it seem like I simply changed my mind and put on a loose gray dress. Since Darren wouldn’t be around, I didn’t bother with much makeup, just enough to cover my bruised face.
By the time I was done and ready, the Russians were being led into my room without so much as a knock. The ladies strolled in with smiling faces while Eric gave me a warning glare from outside before shutting the door.
Don’t worry, buddy, you’ll really be loving me by the end of the night.
As the women began to set up, Irina turned to me and began combing my wet hair, but as she did, she stopped and noticed the large make-up covered bruise on the side of my face. Her eyes immediately lit up with concern as her face began to soften. Her hand reached up for my cheek and her thumb grazed just along the outside, showing me her concern.

I put my hand on her wrist and looked at her with caution in my eyes. I slowly shook my head, telling her I was okay and not to make a spectacle out of it. She then removed her hand and gave me a quick little nod, understanding my body language. She went back to combing my hair and parting it for the cut.
When Anya was ready, I sat down at the table where Irina continued to trim away at my strands while Anya took care of my nails. I eyed the nail glue that was conveniently close to me and I hoped I could swipe it without either of them noticing.
Anya made quick work of my nails, but this time, she painted them a bright Barbie pink. My face immediately turned to disgust at the hideous color. I knew Darren chose that on purpose to piss me off. Whelp, I was really about to piss him off later tonight.
When Anya and Irina finished, my hair was perfectly styled and my nails were back to their old Barbie ways. As Anya and Irina packed up, I managed to slip my hand over the nail glue and quickly put it in my pocket. Neither one of them noticed a thing. Anya was always so quick to pack everything up, her nerves always getting the best of her, so I doubted she would even notice.
Before they left, Irina gave me one last look of concern, her worry for my well-being refreshing but uncomfortable for me. I didn’t want them to end up the same way the gardener had. I gave Irina a quick, sly wink, and she seemed to receive it well.
The rest of my day went without issue. I hid the glue in my bathroom cabinet and went down to the theater to finally watch the entire final season of Sons of Anarchy, but it just made me anxious to ride off on one of Darren’s motorcycles. I had to admit the ending did piss me off, but I could see it coming a mile away.
I had dinner alone in the dining room, a guard standing watch not far behind. It felt like I was rarely out of someone’s sights; the only place that didn’t contain a guard was my bedroom, but I was sure they were watching me through the cameras. I just hoped it wasn’t every second of every day.
Around ten o’clock, I headed back to my room, washed my face, brushed my teeth, and got ready for bed. I looked at the bottled vase on my dresser, noticing the flowers now looked somewhat old enough to throw out. I took the bottle into the bathroom, dumped out the water, threw the flowers in the trash, and left the bottle on my counter. I then returned to my

room, turned on my fireplace, and sat down in front of the flames to meditate for a while. I felt the warmth of the fire as I listened to my breathing. My body relaxed, one muscle at a time, as I quieted my mind to perfect silence.
In and out, my chest slowly rose and fell with each deep breath I took, and within ten minutes, I was calm and ready. I went to bed at 11:00 p.m. on the dot without a fuss, but of course, I barely got a moment’s worth of sleep—too damn amped up.
I basically stared at the clock until 2:59 clicked to 3:00 a.m.
Game on.







Chapter Thirty-Eight. Escape.
Like a cat on a rooftop, I silently slipped from my sheets, grabbed the
matches from my drawer, clutching them in my fist, and headed to the bathroom. I quickly used the toilet, making it seem like I was just going to the bathroom. I had no idea if someone was watching me 24/7. I really doubted it, but after tonight, I wouldn’t be surprised if someone had to start following me around everywhere I went.
I kept the bathroom lights off as I took the two soles of my shoes and began to glue the ends together with the nail glue. They stuck together almost instantly. I allowed the glue to dry as I grabbed the glass-bottled vase and placed it in the cabinet. My heart began to pound away in my chest as I filled the bottle with a little bath oil and lots of rubbing alcohol. I then tucked a thin washcloth into the bottle, allowing it to soak in the solution and left the rest hanging out of the top. I then walked to the window of my bathroom and opened the screen.
My bedroom led out to the patio, and right below my bathroom window was the barbecue equipped with a full propane tank. I set the bottle down on the window ledge, took a deep breath … and struck the match. This was it. No going back now.
I lit the cloth and threw the match out the window. I watched the flame claim the makeshift wick, realizing that after this, everything was going to change. All it would take was one final push and everything would quite literally explode. Consequences be damned. I wanted Darren to know he wasn’t fucking with no ordinary bitch. He wanted a challenge? Well, good because I was about to turn up the heat. I took one final breath, releasing it slowly through my mouth, and finally smiled as I lightly pushed the bottle with my fingertip and watched it fall out of the window.
I listened as the glass shattered and the flames engulfed the patio as well as the side of the house. And then, not more than a few seconds later, a large boom echoed from outside sending my heart into a frenzy, as I could

practically feel the flames from my bathroom window. As if a starter pistol had gone off, I immediately ran to the counter, pulling my hair up into a high-knotted bun and quickly slipping my rubber protector under my collar. It fit perfectly snug. I soon heard the shouting of the guards as they quickly collaborated to contain the fire below my window. I then quickly changed into my clothes, laced up my Nikes, and bolted from my bedroom.
I could hear shouting and orders being given as I stealthily made my way down the stairs, through the halls and to the garage, adrenaline pumping through my veins so loud I could hear it. My senses were hyper aware now as I heard two guards coming my way, and I immediately hid in the shadows of the house, watching them pass right by me as they headed for my bedroom.
When I finally reached the garage undetected, I pressed the button opening one of the many doors, grabbed the key to the Panigale that was hanging from the hooks on the wall, climbed on the bike, and roared that motherfucker to life. Feeling the throttle in my hand, I revved the engine, more excitement and adrenaline pumping through me as I put the bike in first and tore out of the garage like a bat out of Hell.
By the time I made it down the driveway, I was already in third, and as soon as I hit the sensor for the gate below the cement, it opened like the pearly white gates welcoming me to Heaven, except I was only just escaping from Hell.
I almost squinted as I waited for the shock to come and cause me to crash, probably killing me on impact, but all I felt was a low vibration that lasted about five seconds and that was it. Relief rushed through me as I realized my plan had worked. One shock was all the collar would administer, and I hoped once Darren found out I was gone and on a bike, he would deactivate it for fear it might actually be the cause of my death.
I peeled out of the gate, nearly squealing the tires as I did, and turned right, remembering from the first day I had been brought here where we had turned. Now that I was on an open, but most likely private road, I screamed out loud in victory. I had fucking done it! No shock! No struggle! No fuck ups! I was actually out of the estate! I couldn’t believe I had really pulled it off. But I wasn’t out of the woods yet. I had a mission to complete and once that mission was over, it didn’t matter if Darren found me again. At least, my family would know to disappear and Darren could no longer hold anything over my head as leverage again.

Kicking the bike into fourth and then fifth gear, I turned my headlights off and made my way through the winding road until I came over a hill and could see what looked like a small town up ahead with a perfect view of a lit-up San Diego beyond it. Perfect.
As I neared the town, fear rushed through me. What if one of the cops here recognized me? I’d surely be fucked. I slowed the bike down and turned off the road lights as I turned down an alley street, not far from a small quiet looking 7-11 before parking the bike behind a big green dumpster.
Darkness shrouded the little town, as there weren’t many streetlights around. Constantly scanning the area, I quietly ran my way across the street and headed into the convenience store, my heart pounding in my ears. I was greeted by a young cashier; a girl barely out of her teens and obviously having a ton of fun during her midnight shift. I walked up to her and smiled. “Hi, I’m sorry to bother you, but my car broke down, and of course,
my cell phone is dead. Is there a phone I could use?” I smiled sweetly at her, acting as if I was really in a jam, and I really was as well as short for fucking time.
“Yeah, sure,” she said slowly, giving me an odd look as she tucked her long blond hair behind her ears. She turned to grab the phone off the counter behind her and hesitantly handed it to me. Yeah, I must look absolutely crazy with these fucking soles around my neck and a giant bruise on my cheek. I hadn’t even bothered to cover it up before I left. No time for that shit right now.
“Oh, thank you so much,” I said dramatically and then sauntered away down one of the aisles to hide and began to dial Jason’s number.
My body shivered with anxiety as I held the phone to my ear and prayed like hell he’d answer. It rang five times and I was beginning to grow nervous as I feared I wouldn’t even get to speak to him. But on the sixth ring, and to my relief, he answered.
“Hello?” came a sad low, sleepy voice. It was him. It was his voice and my heart stopped momentarily as I had almost forgotten how it sounded. “Hello? Who is this?” came the voice again, and I shook my head in an attempt to escape the ice that had suddenly consumed my body.
“Jason?” I practically gasped.
There was a pause. I almost panicked.
“Jaden? Jaden, is that you?” He sounded confused and scared.

“Yeah, Jason, it’s me, but listen, I don’t have a lot of time-”
“Holy fuck! I knew you were alive! Where are you? Are you all right?
What happened? Where-” I had to cut him off.
“Jason, stop, I don’t have a lot of time. I’m fine, but I won’t be unless you listen to me very carefully right now.”
“What’s going on? Where are you?”
“Jason, I was kidnapped and sold into human trafficking. I was purchased by a very dangerous man who is keeping me hostage.”
“Who has you, Jaden? Who? I will fucking kill them!”
“Jason, stop and listen to me! You need to disappear. He’s planning to kill my entire family to bring me to heel. You need to warn everyone and tell them to run.”
“I don’t understand, Jaden. What’s this guy’s name? Who is he?”
“I don’t want to tell you, Jason. If I tell you, you will get involved, and I can’t have that. You have to disappear, please, for my sake.”
“Jaden, goddamn it, tell me who the miserable fuck is who took you so I can kill him and bring you home!”
“Jason, you cannot come looking for me. If he finds you, he will make me watch him kill you just to spite me. And believe me, Jason, if you don’t disappear now, he will find you. He has connections everywhere, including the police. Please don’t make me go through that.”
I suddenly heard sirens in the background, and my panic began to rise all over again as I kept my eyes glued to the windows.
“Listen to me. Take all of our savings and leave the country. Do not go to the police or the FBI, I don’t trust them. He has informants everywhere. Take my mom and brothers and go to Stuttgart like you’ve always wanted to. I will find you there. It may take me a few years, but knowing you’re still alive will give me the motivation I need to keep going. I risked a lot to escape him so I can warn you, but there’s a GPS tracker on me so he’ll find me soon. Please don’t make this escape to have been in vain. Please, Jason.”
Jason was silent for a few seconds, his voice shaking when he finally spoke.
“I don’t know if I can do that. I can’t just abandon you.”
“You’re not abandoning me. You’re removing the leverage he has over me from the equation. If I have nothing left to lose, then I’m that much

more dangerous. I will bring him down, Jason, I promise you, but I can’t do that if he can continue to hold you against me. Do you understand?”
He didn’t say anything, and I could tell he was debating with himself over this.
“Jason! I’m serious!” I yelled at him.
“Yes, all right, fine,” he finally said, and it broke my heart to fucking pieces.
I could hear the sirens getting closer and panic rose all over again. “Listen, I’ve got to go. Warn everyone, pack up, and leave right this
fucking second. Get my family out of the country now. Don’t wait. I will find you, I promise. Just don’t give up on me, okay?”
“I love you, Jaden Wilder. You kill this guy and come home to me, you understand?” he said, sounding stronger.
“I love you, too, and I swear I will. Now run.”
I took everything I had to hang up that phone, but I had no choice.
I placed the phone back on the counter and thanked the girl before heading out of the door and booking it back to the bike. But the moment I reached it, three cop cars with blaring sirens and flashing lights pulled into the alley.
Now that I had completed my mission, I had a new goal in mind. Time to have some fun and make myself famous.



At 6:35 in the morning, I had completed my morning 7k run and finished things off with some bench-pressing with Scott as my spotter. I was staying at my apartment in upstate New York, working the final agreements for a new contract with our arms dealer here. As Scott spotted, we discussed potential setbacks if this new contract didn’t pan out the way it needed to. I knew what I expected, but I never let my guard down when it came to business.
The door to my weight room opened with one of my guards rushing in with his cell phone clutched to his chest. His face was glossy with sweat, and his eyes were lit with obvious anxiety. What the fuck happened now?
“Sir, there’s been a situation,” he practically squeaked.
I completed my fifteenth rep of 525 pounds and set the weights back into place, sitting up to wipe the sweat from my brow with my arm. I held

my hand out for the phone, and he quickly handed it to me. “What,” I said sternly. It was too early for this shit. “Sir, there’s been a bit of a situation, but I don’t-”
“I’m aware there’s a situation, asshole. Now, what it is?” I practically spat to Eric. I hated when people tried to beat around the bush with me.
“Jaden’s escaped, sir.”
My mind instantly went blank as I pondered what he had just said.
She what?
As my comprehension of his words connected, rage began to simmer my blood to a boil.
“What,” I said dangerously, slowly rising from the bench.
“I’m not sure how she did, but she managed to start a fire outside of the house and took off on the Panigale. Her GPS signal shows she made it into town, so I don’t know how she made it past the perimeter with her collar activated.”
Son of a bitch …
I pinched the bridge of my nose. “Is she, at least, wearing a helmet?” I asked beyond annoyed and pissed off.
“I don’t believe so, sir,” Eric replied. “But Hagen has already been informed. He and his men are searching for her right now, along with Colin and Tristan. Ken and I are already on the road, as well, and the fire has been contained. Though there was a significant amount of damage and several men were injured.”
I released a long irritated sigh and nearly crushed the phone in my hand. “Find her,” I ordered and hung up, tossing the phone back to Mike and dismissing him. I grabbed my personal phone and immediately deactivated the shocking mechanism to Jaden’s collar. I didn’t need it accidentally shocking her while she was on a motorcycle with over 200 horsepower and no goddamn helmet.
“What happened?” asked Scott.
I tilted my head back to stretch my neck and exhaled a heavy breath. “My little hellcat has escaped her cage,” I replied.
“Ha!” Scott almost started laughing. “Damn, that girl is full of surprises.”
“No shit,” I said, placing my hands on my hips and beginning to pace my workout room. “Conniving little bitch,” I whispered under my breath. “How close are we to finding the rest of her family?”

We had most of the addresses already, but we were missing a few out of state, and I wanted every bit of information we could find before I decided to execute my plan.
“We’re only missing two addresses. She has an aunt and uncle in Louisiana and a cousin somewhere in northern Michigan,” Scott replied.
“I want those addresses tonight. No excuses,” I ordered. Scott nodded.
“And let’s send a couple of our guys out to pay her uncle in Muskegon a little visit, huh? I want to have something fresh for her to watch while I fuck the ever living shit out of her.”
“Will do,” Scott said, already prepared with his phone. “And get Hagen on the phone,” I ordered.
“Already dialing him,” Scott replied as he held the phone up on speaker.
Hagen answered on the first ring.
“Hey, buddy, what’s goin’ on?” he said, sounding slightly distracted. “You pick up my little runner yet?” I asked him harshly.
“Not yet, but we’re hot on her heels. I gotta hand it to her. Your girl is fast on that thing.”
I almost groaned out loud thinking about Jaden riding around on my bike at high speeds and without a helmet. I knew she knew what she was doing, especially since she was on the same bike she used to own herself, but mine was modified, and if she crashed I would absolutely fucking lose it.
“Apprehend her carefully, Hagen. I don’t need her crashing and getting herself killed, you hear me?”
“Yeah, I hear ya. She’ll be fine. What do you want me to do with her when we get her?”
“Just keep her in a secluded holding cell. I’ll pick her up when I get back.”
“You got it.”
“I want a full report when she’s safe, got it?”
“Yeah, yeah. Look, I gotta go. I’ll call ya when we have her.” And he hung up.
“Pull up her security tapes,” I told Scott as I began to slowly pace again.

He opened the laptop nearby and fiddled around with it until he turned it toward me to reveal the last hour before she escaped. I sat down and watched intently on how she figured out exactly what would enable her to escape. I saw her go to sleep, woke up in the middle of the night, and basically created a Molotov cocktail with the shit in her own bathroom. How the fuck had I let this happen? But what really blew my mind was when she took what looked like rubber shoe soles, glued them together, and wrapped them around her throat under the collar.
“Son of a bitch …” I muttered under my breath.
She then changed her clothes and bolted the fuck right out, bypassing all my fuck-up guards and taking off on my blacked out Panigale. I slammed my fists down on the table and rose from my chair so fast that it slammed down to the floor behind me.
“Fuck!” I roared. I paced back and forth, trying to contain my rage until I finally started laughing at the audacity of it all. I guess Jaden was right. I really had underestimated her.
“Call Moross,” I told Scott. “Tell him I want to meet an hour earlier so we can wrap this shit up. We have a flight to catch.”







Chapter Thirty-Nine. Chase.
The wind whipped through my hair as I took off down the alley, burning
rubber as I tore off into the town. I knew it was that sheriff on my ass, along with a few of his men. I took a quick look back as I sped down the main street and saw three flashing cop cars on my tail. Well, the gig was up, but at least, I had completed my mission, and now, I wanted to take it a step further. I wanted to see if I could make myself famous.
I tore off into the main road, making a right and headed for the big city I could see way off into the distance. It looked like it was maybe twenty miles away. I kicked the bike all the way into fifth gear, riding eighty miles an hour in a forty-mile zone, hoping it might actually cause a helicopter to enter the chase. I wanted my fucking face all over the news so the world could see me.
Thankfully, with it being past three thirty in the morning and stuck in a small town, there was no one around. No cars on the street, no walking passersby to accidentally run over. Besides the sirens blaring behind me, it was actually a pretty quiet and peaceful night, and with the wind and hair in my face, I almost felt free. Almost.
I knew the speed I was going at was dangerous. Plus, I didn’t have a helmet. But fuck, I hadn’t been on a bike for several months, and I missed the rush my Ducati at home could give me. I could not believe my luck in finding out that Darren had the same bike as I did. Even all the settings on the bike were perfect. Darren was so going to kick my ass after this.
The cops were closing in on me now, yelling at me to pull over, but I just flipped them off knowing they were dirty anyway. And then I noticed something black and shiny keeping up with me on the next street over. I looked to my right and saw the exact same thing. Darren’s guards. They were trying to close me in.
I saw as they sped up even more, and then suddenly, they turned a corner onto the main street and blocked the entire street. I kicked it into

sixth gear and brought my speed up to 96 mph and left the cops in my dust. I could see the guards exit their vehicles yelling at me to stop, but just before I reached them, I decelerated, and maneuvered right between their cars, nearly running them over. I noticed the drivers remained in their cars and immediately took off after me.
Once I passed them, I decided to have a little fun. I pulled the clutch in just enough as I brought my RPMs to rise up to the torque peak and then quickly released, the front tire lifting and bringing me into a fantastic wheelie as I tore off down the street.
With my headlights still off, I quickly sped down another street with fewer lights, hoping to conceal myself better. Darren couldn’t have made it easier with the bike completely blacked out. The only thing that really gave me away was that my engine was loud as fuck. I headed down another street that ran parallel to the main road, still hoping to make it to the city.
I could still hear the sirens and the roar of the BMWs in the background until my GPS signal finally revealed the street I was on. But then something magical happened as I felt a searchlight come over my bike, with the whopping sound of helicopter blades above. I looked up at the giant newscaster helicopter and smiled. Bingo.
But now my location was completely given away and stealth mode quickly became obsolete.
I turned my lights back on and took off, popping another quick wheelie, but only to suddenly find three black BMWs ahead of me, with the cops closing in behind me. Fuck, they might actually box me in.
I was going too fast to make a quick turn, and if I slowed down, the cops behind me would definitely box me in. If I sped up, the three BMWs would prevent my advance. Shit.
The three BMWs ahead of me were flanked in a triangle formation and all at once, they all started to hit their brakes with the cops no more than ten feet behind me, way too close for comfort. But then, eventually, everyone got too close and successfully blocked me in. I hit my brakes, both BMWs that now flanked my sides pulled in so close that they were less than a foot away from me.
As soon as we were at a dead stop, the BMWs were close enough to me that I was able to reach out with my legs and press their car doors closed with my feet. They pushed and jammed on the doors, yelling at me to knock it off, but I didn’t know quite what they were thinking. There was barely

any room for their doors to open anyway with bike successfully wedged between them. One of them finally got smart and started to roll down their window while one of the guards in the driver’s seat got out.
In a rush, I kicked off one of the doors and managed to leap out between the cars, landing on the top of the BMW to my right, jumping off the hood, and taking off at a dead run. All sorts of lights were on me as more adrenaline pumped through my veins while the cops ran after me, shouting my name along with orders I did not intend to follow.
One of the cops finally caught up with me and made the mistake of grabbing my upper arm. I turned and side kicked him in the gut and then retracted for a second kick right under his chin. Another cop advanced on me, attempting to strike my face, but I quickly spun low, knocking his ankles out from under him and dropping the motherfucker to the ground. I then quickly slammed an axe kick right down on his throat. A third cop came up behind me and grabbed both my arms, while another came up in front of me and tried to hit me in the face.
I instantly moved my head to the side and he ended up punching the cop behind me in the mouth. I kicked the guy in front of me in the face and sent him back a few feet while I swiftly brought my heel up between the legs of the cop who held me and shot it up into his groin. He loosened his hold immediately, allowing me to slam my elbow into his face several times before he finally loosened his grip. I was then able to take hold of his arm, lock it, and then tossed his limp ass over my shoulder, slamming his body into the ground and forcing another axe kick into his gut.
By then, the rest of the cops made it to the scene and basically dog piled me to the ground. I screamed in absolute rage as I felt something prick the side of my arm. A wave of dizziness quickly consumed me as it dawned on me that my hands were now being cuffed behind my back. I was then yanked to my feet and held up by my upper arms as my mind fought against the drug they had pumped me with.
All kinds of shouting was going on, but I couldn’t make out a single word. Flashing lights blurred together in a storm of red and blue as I was dragged to a squad car. I looked on to the distance to find Darren’s guards leaning up against their cars, one of them smoking a cigarette as they watch me get carted off with the cops. Two of them I didn’t recognize, as they were both dressed in black suits and actually looked like the same person. I

gave them all a cocky smile and laughed. I was sure they were in just as much trouble as I was.
The ground beneath me felt like it was crumbling with each step I took. It felt like I had downed an entire bottle of tequila on an empty stomach … in an hour. My vision blurred, sounds were nothing but noise, and my stomach felt like it was on a roller coaster.
Eventually, I realized I had been tossed into the back of a cop car and was now on my way to wherever the fuck they were taking me. I presumed back to Darren’s. As we drove, I laid on my side; my legs sprawled out across the seat as I groaned from the effects of the drug.
“Where we going, boys?” I asked as if I was some child tired from a long road trip.
One of the cops looked back through the fenced window and acknowledged me. He was the sheriff who brought the gardener to Darren. Hagen, I think his name was.
“Ya know, you’re in a lot of trouble, little lady,” he said with a toothpick in his mouth.
“Yeah, no shit.” I giggled and then finally blacked out in the backseat.







Chapter Forty. The Wait.
I woke up hours later, groggy, thirsty, and with a pounding headache. I
barely opened my eyes to find I was, in fact, not back at Darren’s, but what looked like a prison cell for solitary confinement. I was lying on a padded bench, surrounded by cement walls, a toilet and sink, and a large door with a single small square window. Panic rushed me.
Lying back down on the bench, I tried to calm myself down. I was nearly shaking now. Darren was probably well aware of the situation, and I wondered if I had possibly ruined his important business trip. Would he come home from it because of my escape or would he continue on knowing his cop buddies had successfully apprehended me? It didn’t really matter. He would be furious anyway, and my punishment would probably last weeks, if not months. Whatever—it was worth it.
Gathering my strength, I slowly stumbled my way to the sink and began dragging handfuls of water to my desert of a mouth. The water calmed my roiling stomach and brought me back to the present as I splashed it on my face. I felt a little better after quickly using the toilet and rinsing my hands and arms under the sink.
Then that sheriff fuck came in without so much as a knock as I dried myself off with some paper towel.
“Well, look who’s up?” he said enthusiastically with a grin.
I glared at him from across the room, instinctively pulling my left leg back and giving him only the side of my body to face.
“The fuck do you want?” I asked with a scowl. He let out a deep sigh before finally speaking.
“Jaden, I’m Sheriff Hagen. We’ve met previously, you remember?” “Like I could forget.”
“Of course,” he said with a nod. “Well, I’m in charge of safety for this little town you just tried to run through last night.”
I raised an eyebrow at him.

“How safe can it be if you have a criminal organization living right under your doormat?” I asked him.
“Oh, you mean Mr. Davis?” he asked casually. “Yeah, that asshole.”
“Well, you see,” he started, “I’ve been working with the Davis’s for over twenty years now. I’ve grown to realize what works and what doesn’t work and how to keep our little town and employees happy.”
“By sleeping with the devil? You sound like a real hero.”
“When you’re in my position, Jaden, you do what you have to do to keep the peace, and if keeping off Mr. Davis’s tail accomplishes that, then I have no problem with it.”
“You mean so long as he continues to pay you for your discretion …” “Well, to each their own.” He chuckled as if it was no big deal.
I shook my head at him. What a piece of shit.
“Anyway, I came to tell you that Mr. Davis is aware of the situation and has requested that we keep you in our custody until he returns from his trip to collect you.”
I rolled my eyes and looked away from him. “And just when will that

be?”

“Tomorrow, I believe.”
“Well, why don’t you go ahead and tell him to take his sweet-ass

time. There’s no rush,” I replied venomously.
“Sure.” He smiled and started to head out, but then turned back to the door and suddenly turned the lights out. I looked over to him in a panic, but he just smirked at me.
“Oh, I was also asked to keep these off until he said otherwise,” Hagen answered and then shut the door. The only light I had was the small amount shining in from the hallway, which wasn’t much. I was then left alone in the dark and I curled into myself on the mattress, silent tears falling down my cheeks until I fell asleep.



For the remainder of the day, I was kept cooped up in that cell in the dark and was fed only once. I was given a simple plastic cup of water and a bologna sandwich with mustard. That was it; but it hardly made a difference since I ended up throwing the nasty shit up anyway. My stomach was still

too fucked up from the drug they gave me to be able to keep anything down. I didn’t know why Darren was having them starve me, though. It didn’t make sense since he was always so keen on my having the perfect body and keeping it healthy. Maybe now he didn’t care.
I pulled the soles of the shoes out from my collar and tossed them in the trash bin. Not like I’d ever get to see those things again. I tried to spend most of my time sleeping off the shitty aftereffects of the drug, but in the end, I still felt like shit. I drank water until I thought my stomach would explode to help flush it out of me, and that seemed to help as I spent most of my night pissing it away or vomiting it up.
For some reason, I was thankful for the darkness in my cell. It provided me with a sense of clarity as I thought about what I had accomplished last night. I had finally proved Darren wrong … and it was an amazing moment. I had showed him that he was not the master of all and that I was capable of far more than he ever imagined. Let this be a lesson to him for fucking with what’s mine!
Hopefully, Jason was halfway around the world by now with my mother and brothers in tow. I hoped Jordan has disappeared to her aunt’s place in Paris, France. She should be safe there. I didn’t know what would happen to the rest of my sparse family or where they would go. I just hoped it was somewhere Darren wouldn’t be able to find them.
The following day, I’d spent hours praying Darren’s plane would crash and he’d die a horrible fiery death, but I doubted that would happen. He’d probably survive the damn thing anyway like the fucking cockroach that he was.
That morning, I had been given a small bowl of bland oatmeal and black coffee for breakfast, both of which I barely touched. I laid on the bench, staring up at the ceiling with my hands behind my head and my ankles crossed, trying to keep myself relaxed for when the time finally came for Darren to come get me. This time it wouldn’t be just a little battle between us; it would be a full-on war. I could feel it in the pit of my stomach. And I knew I was going to fucking lose and lose hard. It was okay, though. I said it would all be worth it, and even though I had no idea what was coming for me, I still didn’t regret a damn thing.
A few hours later, the lights suddenly came on and bright light instantly blinded me. I squinted my eyes but remained in my relaxed position as someone stepped through the door. I didn’t even have to fully

open my eyes to know who it was. My entire body could sense him before my eyes could even register him. I could probably pick him out of a crowd blindfolded.
My muscles tensed as my nose caught a whiff of Darren’s scent and my stomach retracted into a thorny bush of knots. Terror began to fill my body knowing he was here and I tried hard not to show my fear, but I could already feel his rage in the air like a thick reminder of how much trouble I was in.
When my eyes had finally adjusted to the light, I formed a sleepy glare on my face before I finally sat up to meet his stare. He was leaned up against the wall nearest the door, his arms crossed over his chest with the most pissed off, terrifying look I had ever seen. It made my blood run cold, and I suddenly felt myself shiver with fear.
Then randomly, he lifted his hands and began to clap slowly, as if he was applauding me. I entertained his gesture and brought my arm up, twisting my wrist and hand up and lowering my head in a bow, a slight smirk on my face.
“Well done, Jaden,” he finally said, his voice low and cold as ice. “You successfully bypassed my security and made it off my estate.”
I just nodded with an amused look as if it was the greatest accomplishment ever. It kind of was.
“Not only did you manage to get away,” he began, “but you also attempted to burn my childhood home to the ground, caused several second-degree burns on many of the men who were there to guard you, stole one of my bikes, and put yourself in serious danger by riding around at high speeds in a small town with no helmet, drawing attention to yourself and making contact with your fucking family. Have I forgotten anything?”
“Probably cussing. I did a lot of that.” I shrugged. Sarcasm always made me feel better.
“Well, now that’s just a given.”
I shrugged again. “Could have been worse. I considered blowing up one of your sports cars, but I didn’t have the time. You should consider yourself lucky.”
A soft laugh left his throat as he rubbed his face and began to pace the room slowly. His suit was a little disheveled and he looked like he hadn’t slept much.

“Do you have any idea of the amount of bullshit I have been dealing with because of you?” he roared at me.
“Well, considering the amount of bullshit you’ve already put countless other women and me through, you cannot imagine the immensity of the fuck I do not give,” I replied harshly.
He slowly shook his head at me. He seemed somewhat collected on the outside, but inside, I knew he was boiling with rage. I couldn’t really blame him, though. But, of course, I wasn’t done fueling the fire.
“I don’t know what the fuck was going through your head when you thought you might actually get away from me. You had to have known I would find you.”
“You and I both know this was never about escaping,” I replied. “It was about sending a message, and I successfully did that, so whatever happens next doesn’t matter to me because I did what I needed to do. And ya know what, let’s just be honest here. You’re not mad at me for getting away. You’re mad at yourself because you underestimated me like I said you would. It’s okay, Darren, you can admit it.”
Darren stared at me for a short second before his mouth curved into a smile and a low chuckle left his throat.
“I suppose you’re right, princess. You are full of unexpected surprises
… but it won’t happen ever again,” he promised darkly. “I’m sure it won’t.” I glared back at him.
Challenge accepted.



I’m not really proud of what I did next, but Jaden had to learn who was in control, that running away or even thinking about running was never an option and that she would always pay for it. For the last twenty-four hours, I had been dealing with some serious damage control. I was running on only a few hours of irritated sleep and was stressed and aggravated beyond belief.
At least, my meeting in New York turned out to be successful as fuck, with this year’s contract promising to be more profitable than last year’s. If Jaden had fucked that up, things would be even worse for her.
I had sent orders out for my men to finish tracking the rest of her family, but most of the immediate ones had suddenly disappeared. Her old

boyfriend had vanished without a trace, along with her mother, brothers, and best friend, which sorely pissed me off. I wanted that fuck’s head on my fucking desk. They did manage to find one family member, though …
I knew Jaden was weak and tired from the slight starvation Hagen had been putting her through. Normally, I would have been against it, but I wanted her to realize how grateful she should be to me for taking care of her at my home. Plus, I wanted her essentially diminished for what I was about to do to her.
The first thing I did was backhand her across the face, purposely splitting her lip. I wanted it to hurt every time I kissed her for the next few days. She groaned, slumping to the side of the bench before I grabbed her and tossed her around the room, slamming her into the walls while she fell to the floor in a heap. She tried defending herself, but when I used as much of my strength as I did, she could barely even stand. I picked her small frame up from the floor and slammed her down onto the padded bench. She groaned as I ripped her skort from her lower body in shreds, finally plunging into her so hard she screamed and immediately began to cry.
Her tears only made me harder as I fucked her with so much force I expected her to feel it for the next several days. But what made it even better … was that she was fucking wet. I had successfully trained her body for this specific conditioned response so that every time she was afraid of me, her body would still want me. And I fucking loved it.
I ripped her shirt in pieces from her body and tore apart her bra, roughly gripping her flesh and biting into her. She tried to claw and punch at me, but I grabbed both of her wrists and slammed them down above her head causing her to shriek in terror.
Good. I wanted her scared. I wanted her absolutely terrified so she would know who she was fucking with and that she was never to run from me again. She would fear me for the rest of her life because she would know exactly what I would do to her should she ever disobey me like this again.
After about a minute, I flipped her over onto her stomach and re- entered her just as hard. She screamed again, clawing at the bench, but she had nowhere to go. I then took out my phone and began to play the video my men had sent me from a day ago. I set it down in front of Jaden’s face and pulled her head back by her hair so she had no choice but to watch.

The video showed her uncle, who lived on his own in Muskegon, Michigan. After my men had tortured him for a short while, they lit his house on fire, leaving him to the flames as she had my home. Luckily, I had a sprinkler system set up for any such occasion.
Jaden screamed and cried even harder as she watched the video. She tried to fight me again, but she had nothing to go on.
“I hope it was worth it, Jaden,” I spat in her ear. “Because if you thought things were bad before, they are about to get so much worse for you. I told you running was a mistake. I told you I would always find you, and now, you’re going to pay the fucking consequences.”
A few seconds later, I came inside her and she continued to scream and cry under me, but I wasn’t letting up. I would never let up.
I picked her back up and tossed her again, fury boiling in my veins as I thought about all the other bullshit she could have accomplished had she had more time. I grabbed her right wrist, pulling her to me and squeezing hard until I felt the bone finally snap from the pressure. She screamed and thrashed as I brought her to my chest and crushed her to me. I cut off her cries as I pulled her face to mine and kissed her fiercely, tasting the fresh blood on her lip.
“Darren, stop, please!” She screamed when I finally pulled away, terror filling her voice, but I refused to back down. I suddenly had no desire to hear her speak. She had broken so many rules, and now, she would learn.
I gripped her jaw, squeezing it in my hand until I felt the bone crunch like sand. Jaden’s muffled screams sent a flurry in my chest as I held her there, her tears falling over my fingers as I kept her mouth shut. I tossed her against another wall before grabbing her again, snaking my arms around her rib cage and tightened my grip until I felt the bones crunch under my weight. Jaden tried to scream, but it only came out as tight little screeches and gasps. I then let go of her and she dropped to the floor in a heap at my feet.
She shook at my feet—fear, pain, and regret pouring from her eyes. I pulled out the needle I had in my pocket and bent down over her broken body. I plunged the needle into her arm and she groaned a little more. I then reach down and spoke into her ear before the drug kicked in.
“Run from me again, Jaden,” I challenged her. “Because if it ever happens again, I can’t promise you I’ll stop next time.”

I heard her whimper slightly before the drug finally took over and she passed out on the floor. I then gently picked her up, wrapped her naked and bruised body in my suit jacket, and carried her in my arms as I walked out of the cell and back toward the lobby. Scott, Hagen, and a few of my men were waiting there as I walked out with Jaden in hand.
“All set?” Hagen asked me as I approached, a little bit of concern in his eyes.
I nodded gravely at him. Now was not the time to ask me questions.
Scott joined me while the rest of my men followed behind. I headed out to the black armor plated Escalade that was waiting for us in the parking lot. I carefully righted Jaden in my arms and laid her in the backseat with me. I eased her head on my lap as she slept the pain I had just caused her away. When she woke up, she wouldn’t be feeling much better.
Everything I did, I had already planned to do. I fractured her jaw because I didn’t want to hear her fucking speak for the next month. I fractured her ribs because I didn’t want her to move a single inch without the painful reminder of her stupid attempt to run. And I broke her right wrist because I wanted her skills diminished so she could see that I could easily take them away if I wanted to.
The car quickly took off as Scott got in the driver’s seat and we headed for my private jet. With my house under construction and Jaden clearly capable of manipulating the shock collar, I needed her recovery to occur in a secure location – one I knew she would never be able to escape from – my private island in the Caribbean.
I already had Sid set everything up for Jaden since she’d be out of commission for a while. He was already there, waiting with a private nurse who would finish the job once Sid had to leave. I only planned to be there for the first couple of days as I had so much more shit to take care of back home. Once I had that under control, I would lay low for a while on the island with Jaden while she recovered, reminding her every day of the rules and what would happen if she didn’t follow them. I was not about to let this fuck-up happen ever again.
I looked down at my sleeping broken beauty and began to string my fingers through the softness of her hair. Even with all the bruises, she was still the most beautiful thing I had ever seen and the thought of her being gone from my life had the storm inside me raging for blood. In a very short span of time, she had become my obsession, my light, my reason for living.

It was the most remarkable thing and completely unexplainable. I didn’t know how to rationalize my need for her, but anything more than a moment away from her presence was absolute torture. I craved her all the time and the fact she fought me at nearly every turn always had me excited as fuck. She was the color in a white room, the sugar in black coffee, and the fire in my darkness.
My addiction.
When Jaden woke up, things were going to be very different for her. If she thought she hated me now, she had no idea what she’d soon be feeling when she finally opened her beautiful amber eyes. Jaden was mine. And I made it my lifelong goal to make her embrace it. And I knew just how to ensure it.
A dark smile formed on my lips as we pulled up to my jet, the sun setting beyond the horizon in a wave of golden embers. The wheels in my head turned a thousand miles a minute while I twirled a strand of Jaden’s red hair around my fingers. So beautiful, so mine … and so infinitely fucked.







Chapter Forty. One Recovery.


I woke up to the sounds of a slow rhythmic beep. Beep … beep … beep over and over again. My eyes felt heavy, my entire body roared with pain, and it felt like a jackhammer was pounding away inside my head. Forcing my eyelids to crack open, I saw the source of the beep. It was a heart monitor. I looked down to notice I was in a hospital bed with an IV inserted into my arm and the heart monitor clip attached to my finger. Groaning, I adjusted my body only to wince in ultimate pain. Everything hurt. Everything.
I tried to open my mouth to call out for someone, and suddenly realized that I couldn’t. I heard the heart monitor spike as fear took over my body as I realized my jaw wouldn’t open. I began to panic and nearly screamed.
“She’s awake,” I heard a male voice call out to someone, and I instantly turned my head to the source to find a guard dressed in a black suit and tie standing beside the door. Then a woman, whom I didn’t recognize, quickly came out of another door near the guard.
“Oh, good,” she said as she rushed over to me. She was older, had short, thin brown hair, with a plumper frame and bright red lips. She looked to be about in her mid-sixties as she came up to my bedside. “Good morning, Miss Wilder. I’m sorry I wasn’t here when you woke up. You must be terribly confused.”
No shit!
I looked at her with panic in my eyes. Who the fuck was this woman and where the fuck was I? And why the fuck couldn’t I open my jaw?!
“Shh, shh, calm down before you further injure yourself. You’re going to be okay. I’m Nurse Ginsby, and I’m going to be taking care of you while you recover from your recent injuries.”

I tried to calm my breathing down as I attempted to get her to tell me the extent of my recent “injuries.” I wanted to know what kind of damage Darren had done to my body. I lifted my right wrist only to wince in serious pain and look down to find it was in a cast.
Motherfucker.
“Now, don’t struggle,” she urged me. “Your right wrist is broken and two of your ribs are fractured. Your lower jaw was also fractured which is why you’re mouth has been wired shut to prevent further injury. You also suffered a slight concussion along with multiple external bruising.”
Now, I was pissed. Darren had not only completely immobilized me, but he also took away my ability to speak and cry for help. He was such a cruel son of a bitch!
“Your prognosis is good, though,” the nurse beamed positively. “You’ve been asleep for a couple of days and your body is already beginning to heal itself at a fine rate. Depending on your amount of rest, you should be all healed up within a few short months and your jaw will be unwired within the next thirty days.”
I raised my eyebrows. Thirty days? My jaw would be wired shut for thirty days?! Rage started to fill me again and the beeps on my heart monitor sped up.
“Now, keep yourself calm,” she pleaded. “Mr. Davis will not be happy if you do something to slow your recovery.”
I gave her the glare of death.
“Where is he?” I mumbled without opening my mouth and then winced. Any kind of vibration I made with my throat hurt my jaw.
“Mr. Davis is away on business and is not currently on the island. He means to return as soon as he knows you’re awake. I imagine he will be here tomorrow.”
“Island?” I asked her. We were on an island now?
“Yes, sorry, you were unconscious when they brought you here. We are on Mr. Davis’s private island.”
“Where?” I spoke softly hoping I might actually have a location disclosed to me for once.
“The Bahamas, and we’re expected to have great weather this season so there should be plenty of motivation for you to get better so you can soak up some of that sun.”

The only motivation I had to get better was so I could kill Mr. Davis myself one day. I sat back against the pillow and tried to relax, looking around the room to familiarize myself with my surroundings. A few chairs were spread throughout the white linoleum floor, a small dinner table complete with four chairs, a comfy looking couch against the window, and a fridge next to what looked like a small kitchen complete with counters, cabinets, and a sink. To my left looked to be the bathroom and another door that I didn’t know what it led to. Further left was another door, where the guard sat in a chair next to it, staring straight ahead. I had a feeling he was a permanent fixture in the room.
“I’m just going to give you a quick assessment, and then I’ll fix you something to eat that your stomach should be able to handle.”
I nodded, and it fucking hurt.
Nurse Ginsby assessed everything—checking my breathing, drawing some blood, and determined my pain scale, which was a fucking twenty, by the way. She told me the IV was for my fluids, antibiotics, and my pain medication. A lovely catheter had also been inserted, and I wondered if that was the source of the soreness I felt down there, or maybe it was from Darren.
When she was satisfied, she went over to the kitchen area and started pulling out some fruit from the fridge. I couldn’t see much of what she was doing, but it looked like she was making me a smoothie, which was probably all I could eat right now. When she returned, she came back with a bottle of water and a smoothie cup with a bendy straw. She cracked the bottle of water open first and put another bendy straw in it.
“Drink this first,” she said. “It’ll ease your stomach.”
She held the water to my mouth, and I tentatively barely opened my lips to take the straw. I lightly sucked on the straw, groaning in pain as I did, but when the water reached my mouth, I felt a wave of instant relief wash over me. The water felt so good in my mouth, and it calmed my now aching stomach. I finished half the bottle before she took it away and put the smoothie in a cup holder that was close enough to reach my face.
“I want you to sip on this for a while. It’s a fruit smoothie with lots of protein and vitamins. I tried to make it as thin as possible, but you’ll need to be careful with the suction so it doesn’t hurt too much.”
I gave her a tiny nod and wrapped my lips around the straw, sucking the thicker liquid down in my gut, the sweet taste of bananas and

strawberries on my tongue. It wasn’t easy to suck the smoothie through my teeth and swallow, but when I did, I felt a small wave of nausea come over me and backed off.
“It’s the medication,” she said. “And the fact you haven’t eaten in the last three days.”
I looked at her in shock. It had been three days? What the fuck?! “We’ve kept you asleep to help your body heal faster,” she replied
without looking at me as she checked my heart monitor. “Now, if you can manage to get a good fourth of that down, I’ll let you sleep, but you really need to get some food in your stomach first.”
I glanced away from her, trying to relax so I could finish more of the smoothie. I took a few more sips before the door to my left opened and I turned to see who it was. A man I recognized instantly. Sid. Darren must have brought him in to help take care of me. He walked his short, fat, old ass toward me, his hands in the pockets of his white doctor coat and addressed the nurse.
“How’s our patient?” he asked her.
Uh, I’m right here, asshole.
“Doing well,” she said, turning to him with a smile. “Vitals are up and her awareness is good. Just trying to get something remotely solid in her stomach so she can rest.”
“Good,” Sid said as he looked over my chart. I eyed him with hatred to the point where I swore he could feel it. When he finally found his balls, he looked up at me with a no-nonsense look on his face. He didn’t care about me. He was just here on Darren’s payroll.
“Hello, Jaden. Remember me?” he asked me.
I rolled my eyes and flipped him off with my good hand. Maybe I should start taking up sign language.
“Of course, you do.” He smiled, looking back down at my chart.
I shook my head at him and looked away toward the window with white open wood blinds. I could see some vegetation growing around the windows, but they certainly weren’t plants I recognized. Definitely tropical.
And then I felt the room spin. Fuck, I was groggy.
“Jaden,” Sid addressed me. I turned my head to glare at him, blinking the random dizziness away. “We’re going to make you better, but we’re going to need your absolute cooperation, understand? Otherwise, your recovery will take longer than expected, and I know you don’t want that.”

If it hadn’t been so painful, I would have snorted with laughter.
Everybody wanted my cooperation. Whatever.
“Now, if you can finish a little more of the smoothie, I’ll give you a sedative to help you sleep.”
Sleep suddenly sounded like a fantastic idea. I really didn’t want to be awake anymore.
I gave Sid another glare before I reluctantly turned and wrapped my lips around the straw to gently suck down more of the smoothie. At least, it tasted good. I managed to get another quarter of it down and that seemed to satisfy him. I laid back against the pillows, suddenly exhausted from the excitement and exertion. Sid walked over to my IV bag and injected something into it.
Within thirty seconds, I felt the drug kick in and my eyes felt even heavier than before. The moment I shut them, I had a feeling I wouldn’t be waking up for the rest of the day.







Chapter Forty-Two. Spark.
The following day, I woke up to find Nurse Ginsby fiddling with something
at the kitchen counter. It looked like she was preparing me another smoothie, the irritating sound of the blender confirming my suspicion. I groaned in protest, wanting nothing more than to disappear back into the blankness of my sleep. I didn’t even dream. There was just … nothing. Quiet, peaceful nothing.
“Oh, good.” The nurse turned to me with a smile. “Sorry I had to wake you, but it’s time for you to eat again since you didn’t eat much yesterday.”
I wasn’t even close to hungry. Just tired, groggy, and achy as hell. I wanted to go back to sleep, especially since I was sure Darren’s stupid ass would be visiting me today. Ginsby checked my monitor and my vitals before placing the smoothie cup into the holder by my face. I took a few sips here and there, tasting pomegranate, cherries, and raspberries … and fuck if it wasn’t amazing.
“On a scale of one to ten, how bad is the pain today?” Ginsby suddenly asked me.
I brought my left hand up, exposed five fingers, and then flashed her two more. I surprisingly didn’t feel as much pain today as I had yesterday. It must have just been the initial shock of things.
“Okay,” she said, nodding as she pressed a few buttons on my monitor. “We’ll up your pain meds just a little bit.”
She then returned to the fridge and brought back another bottle of water, cracked it open, topped it with a bendy straw and placed it in the other holder. I took a few sips of that, ignoring the pain in my jaw from the suction.
“I’ve been informed to tell you that Mr. Davis will be here to see you within the hour. He landed on the island late last night, but you were asleep then.”

Like that’d stop him.
I was sure Darren had already visited me last night; I just wasn’t awake to know it and thank God for that. If I saw him a hundred years from now, it’d still be too soon. The nurse then grabbed a small tablet and set it on the table beside my bed.
“If you need to tell me anything specific, you can use this. There are also several apps on there for games, movies, and reading. No web browsing, though, I’m afraid.”
Of course, not.
“Is there anything else you need right now?” she asked me.
Oh, the things I needed right now …
The list was way too long and impossible to accomplish, so I gave her a small shake of my head and she nodded.
“Okay. Just push this button if anything changes, okay?” she said, pointing to the small red button on the left side of my bed. I nodded at her and she went on her way, picking up a book on the table and sitting down to read.
For the next thirty-five minutes, I laid there, absolutely bored out of my mind and completely disinterested in the tablet. I didn’t feel like playing a game, watching a movie, or reading. I wanted my body to heal so I could get the fuck out of here. Sid came by for a few minutes to check on me, but he didn’t have anything useful to say. Just that I needed to rest and cooperate.
I spent quite some time analyzing my room and the world outside of the windows. I could hear birds; they sounded different, but I liked it. I could hear the ocean, so it didn’t sound like we were too far from the beach, but that was literally all I could hear. No cars, no horns, no people, just nothing. I had been isolated all over again.
A few minutes later, I heard the door to my left open, and I closed my eyes in anguish knowing it was Darren. I could feel him before he even opened the door, my body so well-tuned to his dominating presence.
“Out,” I heard him say, and the mere sound of his voice brought tremors to my skin.
The guard and the nurse both immediately stood and left the room without a word, leaving me alone with him. I kept my head turned away from him as I focused on the sunlight outside the window, but the slow

rhythmic sound of his footsteps against the tiled floor made it hard to ignore.
He stopped at the left side of my bed, and I tensed from how close he was. He then leaned down and took the side of my still bruised face in his hand, rubbing his thumb along my cheek before placing a soft kiss on my temple. A wave of emotion came over me as I cringed into myself, two single tears falling down my face. Fear, rage, and pure unadulterated hatred all washed over me like a tidal wave and I instantly wished I was dead.
“How’s my princess?” Darren asked with that snide attitude of his.
Yeah, he was considering this some personal victory. Fuck him.
I didn’t respond, just curled my lips in disgust while his thumbs gently wiped away my tears. He rose up then and walked toward the window, his hands resting behind his back. I glanced at him from the corner of my eye. He was in another suit of course; black jacket, black pants, white dress shirt, and black tie, clean-shaven, and hair styled to perfection.
Just go …
He sighed heavily and finally spoke.
“I expect you to cooperate with Sid and his staff to ensure your recovery. We will not leave the island until I’m satisfied with your progression. So in essence, I’m giving you some control of when we return home. It’s all up to you.”
Oh, how sweet of him.
Darren then turned away from the window to address me, his hands remaining behind his back as he glared at me from across the room.
“I hope by now you realize escaping is not an option, and something you will never want to consider again. As I’ve said before, things can always get worse, and as of now, they will be.”
I was already aware things were going to get worse. I had calculated that long ago, but I was worried as to how bad he would make them.
“You will not take a single breath without my knowledge of it. You will not move or speak unless granted permission by me. All of your “freedoms” have been revoked and you can consider the luxury of privacy nonexistent. From now on, you will have twenty-four-hour supervision with several bodyguards, and you will not take a single step without my say-so first. Not until you can be trusted—if ever.”
Darren then headed over to my bedside and pulled a folded piece of paper from his jacket pocket. He unfolded it and tossed it into my lap, but I

didn’t have the courage to move my eyes.
“And as for your little plan to save your family, you were not as successful as you thought you’d be. I have a strategy for everything, Jaden. Don’t ever forget that and maybe next time you can save yourself the wasted pain and energy.”
I winced my lips in absolute anger, but the pain radiating in my jaw brought more tears to my eyes. I fought against them, but they continued to well in the corners until one finally fell.
“I hope it was worth it,” he said, straightening his jacket. “Because, as of yesterday, you’re no longer a missing statistic. You’re officially dead to the world.”
I squinted in confusion as his words registered. What in the hell did he mean I was officially dead to the world? I finally looked up at him with my confusion, but he just smiled at me, leaned down, and kissed my forehead before righting himself.
“Get well soon, princess.” He smirked. “I have a whole new curriculum for you, and I can’t wait to get started.”
With that, he sauntered out of the room with his hands in his pockets, looking perfectly pleased with himself as he opened the door and walked out, the guard and nurse returning in his stead.
I looked down at the piece of paper he placed on my lap and instantly saw my name in bold letters. I picked the paper up with my good hand and realized it was a news article, but the title had me confused and horrified all at the same time. “Body found in Detroit Alley Confirmed as Missing 25- Year-Old, Jaden Wilder.” My eyes widened while my heart monitor practically blasted from my pounding heart.

“Local police confirm the body found in an alley in downtown Detroit yesterday was identified as the missing woman. Severe thermal burns prevented fingerprint identification, but dental records have provided positive identification. The cause of death has been determined as a drug overdose. The remains were later soaked with gasoline and lit on fire, possibly to prevent identification. Police have been unsuccessful in locating the woman’s mother and boyfriend to claim the body, but some of her distant family members have stepped forward. Funeral arrangements are being made for this Sunday …”

My mind swam in a whirlpool of panic and terror as I couldn’t even finish reading the article. I was dead. The world thought I was dead, and they were planning a funeral. A funeral where people who knew me might be, who would now unknowingly be placing themselves in danger. Not only that but another person, one whom I didn’t even know, had taken my place on my deathbed and would now be buried six feet under because of me. Her family would never know the truth and neither would mine.
I suddenly couldn’t breathe. My mouth instantly went dry and my vision spun like a carousel. I felt myself begin to hyperventilate while the heart monitor beeped like crazy.
“Jaden, Jaden, calm down,” I heard the nurse say. “Jaden, I need you to calm down!”
My body shook in uncontrollable terror. Darren had won. I had failed my family because he knew their hearts better than I did. They wouldn’t believe Jason if they were told I was dead. Thankfully, he and my mother and brothers were gone. He could keep them safe. I knew he could, but I couldn’t say the same for everyone else.
Nurse Ginsby panicked around me as she tried to get me to calm down, but there was no hope there. I didn’t even realize I was screaming until I noticed my tears fall onto the paper article. I crinkled the thing in my hand until Ginsby finally grabbed it and tore it away from me.
“Shit!” I heard her say as she started to pull a needle from one of the drawers nearby. I gripped and pulled at my hair as I practically thrashed in my bed. “Help me!” she yelled at the guard. He rushed over and held me down so she could stick the needle in my IV without missing.
“Shhh, Jaden. Shhh, it’s okay,” she said, trying to soothe me and she ran her hands through my hair, pushing it away from my face.
I felt a surge of exhaustion consume me and heard my heart monitor begin to slow again. My breathing eventually evened out as I rested my head against my pillow, tears still falling down my face, but it didn’t silence the terror that resided in my heart.
It was over. I had lost, and now, I would remain on this island, broken and powerless against the hurricane I swore I would destroy. I closed my eyes and choked back a sob. What more could I do now?
Stop it.
I had nothing left. Nothing more to fight with. I was so weak and pathetic. Broken.

Stop being a little bitch, Jaden.
My fight was useless. He would always win. Always. How did I ever think I could compete with him? He was ruthless. He was cruel. And he owned me.
Knock it the fuck off and wake up. You’re better than this.
What could I do? I was so weak.
You can stand the fuck back up because you’re stronger than this.
Don’t be such a pussy.
I took a deep breath and relaxed, nearly smiling.
There was another fight that was always useless, one I constantly lost no matter how hard I fought it … and that was against my inner spirit. The one thing Darren could never break. She was right. I had to stop being a little bitch and stand back up. Darren chose me for my strength, and he would get nothing less. I might be broken now, but I would heal. I would regain that spark and light Darren’s entire world on fire.
It was not over. It never would be until I had Darren Davis dead at my feet and his entire criminal organization decimated to ashes. Only then would I be done.
Relief and pride filled me as I closed my eyes, finally giving in to the drug the nurse had administered. I would have my vengeance … right after this nap …

To be continued… In Book 3.
